# Post combat

## Long Rest

1. Lock + Camilla
2. Neil + Samaroth
3. Bit

Lock only has 49 ft of rope. Improvised molitov

Last watch gets long rest during watch -- logistics op

## Long Rest Completed

Lock rolls `12` for encounter and we meet an orc with some food
We buy 50 camp supplies for `7 Gold`, we then move on for the final day.
Something about a huge mushroom - Neil makes a good History roll: A lot of gnomes live in large mushrooms but this one is gnarly and doesnt look like it's going to be one of the ones that gnomes live in.

Big mushroom guy asks who we are.
Samaroth is leading conversation, the big weird guy's name is: Nyrn Silverstring, we are here for the mushrooms job.

He rambles on about talking animals and comes back with his mosset coat, living moss on the side, walks with a dank rod looking stick. Hes going to take us to the warehouse an hour from his house. 'Perfect timing' is said because it's almost dusk.

You can only get into the warehouse at night. The other groups didn't believe him which is why they left.

Are dragons normally in this region: History check says that they have never seen dragons in this reagion.
This guy has an affliction for mushrooms - we dont have a name for this team.

Man picks cat up: Why cant the guy go get him? He says hes not prepared to go into the warehouse. And that he is not prepared. There are many small voices inside the warehouse.
He dosent seem to want to come with us.
What happens if we don't come back before day - cant get back until the next day.
Master is also a Gnome - they live a long time.

- Very old fart.
Why is he stuck in the warehouse?
- He always told Nyrn that it could take him a long time to leave. But it has been 8 months and hes getting concerned.
Very aware of the `Throne of Eternity Conflict`
- Calendar system is based on this
- The throne of eternit refers to the places where aternus the creator resides this place is not a plane of existance it exists oit iside the realm of idea. Until Imperious the god of order and then went god of tyranny - assembled other minor deities to support him and thought to ascend to claim the throne of Eternity and end chaos. A bunch of gods had conflicting ideas. A thousand year war waged. all places except inside the veil.
- Old story and there is a bit of random stuff thrown in and many renditions.
- A thousand years of unrecorded history.

Master's Name: The Great Taterthorn the Timeless.

Points to smoke in the distance and up ahead is the warehouse.

We begin to hear a singing voice, in a language we don't understand - pudgey bald dwarf - small shack is all his home.
Really bad living conditions - hes sitting on a log saying 'waard'. He knows Nyrn gives him a hug. His name is Waard apparently.

He passes out and his body transforms into a large building. He is the warehouse. It's a grandious building.

We all went into the building and vanished from the plane.
Telepathic connection to Severath was severed. So it is a different dimention.
Hes the potato mage? apparently not sure what this means.

## Dungeon Paths

directions

1. large set of stairs to an upper floor
2. bottom floor - basement room
3. main floor - strange hexagonal door
4. left wall - rectangular door, horizontal

sunset: 20:00, 6:00 sun will come (12 hrs) and the warehouse will

Camilla takes `14` damage from potato explosion

Wondering if Bit knows anything about this mage..
The door we came in no longer teleports us out. So we are locked in this place.

`Taterthorn Tott` - can be consumed for 1 camping supplies, eaten as BA for `1` hp. When 2 of them come into contact with eachother they deal `1d12` of starch damage each

The potatoes can be disarmed by cutting off a piece
We head to the hexagonal door - Neil grabs the door and his body expands - teleports to another area.

We are all lv 4 now.

# Episode 7: Neither here nor there

We left off in front of a door in the potato mage's dungeon.

Nern the mushroom gnome guy

I pick up a book and I can read celestial -- All of the books are exactly the same.
> Upon opening the book in the middle of the page reads: Alone I walk I shall not talk the lanturns light the way. Throught the hall the visions call of future past and present day. Although I feat the end is near I shall not let out a shout. For if I do the walls hear too and there will be no way out.

We conversed via my telepathic speach and decided to journey to the only lanturn that was unlit. As we approached the lanturn began to spark to a different hue depending on the pc that approached.

We approached the lanturn each around 70ft apart or else the flame would go out.

```
Lock: Green
Bit: Purple
Neil: Yellow
Samaroth: Black
Camilla: Ice Blue (Minecraft)
```

I tied a rope around my waist and as I walked through it went limp.
Now we all get solo sessions because we are all about to die.

We wake up and our vision comes back post vision

Lock, Neil and Samaroth grabbed a door and exploded into entrails.
I cast knock on the door and it did nothing and I explode with them.

We materialize on the otherside of this 'door' - we are in a densely packed swamp/jungle pooring rain on us.
About shin deep in water.

Neil climbs up a jungle tree and sees that there are very tall trees and a clearing in the distance. Large and rectangular where there are no trees - few old poorly built buildings. Small arena/event pit in the area.

Samaroth saw his father. The other entity in the vision was a demon named Ky'Mytha that powers my blade. He's terrifying but helps Samaroth out. In exchange for ... nat 20 deception.

Lock saw the demon of duskar - his father was there on the battle field.

We share stories on the walk over. Some share more than others. There are people after Bit, Samaroth, and Camilla.

We hear what sounds to be a few voices - smells like something is cooking.

> At this point it has been 3 hours since we entered. We have a total of 12 hours to get out. Leaving us with 9 hours.

Big beasts are saying 'im hungry now' and that the other 'is working on it'

A couple of trolls approach us thinking we are food.

We play pig jokey with some trolls so we can eat dinner with them.

Not sure what pig jokey is but we are heading over to the arena now - we go to a pen first to pick out our warthogs.

nat 19 animal handling gets me a

We end up at the main area again. And we choose to venture into the basement.

We go to the basement and melt when we touch the door. We end up in a large lava place.

Watch Check: 9 hours have gone by leaving 3 hours left

Neil lost 10 feet of rope, has 90 left.

I'm relying on neil to go up, and the lava is rising environmental turn starts

Neil -> Samaroth -> Bit -> Camilla -> Lock -> Environment

Bit had to leave due to a cat getting scratched in the eye.

# Episode 8: A Wizard of Old

Last session we traversed into the strange werehouse we noticed a few things these rooms dont seem to make much sense first is sa silent library that some thing felt like it was wastchgin neil all of us were brought on our own path and saw various things. Some shared some did not. We then did pig jousting and Locke won the tournament. Afterwards we traversed up a destroyed tower that began sinking in lava. After many flame imps killed, ropes cut down, and we ended up in a gradios large double doors. We were popped into pea size things and we .. ended up in a large dining hall.

There are plates set but no food on it. Neil is holding an imp and we are looking to interrogate it. Camilla attempts however it doesn't seem to speak a lick of our tongue.
It takes us an absurdly long time to kill an imp with 6 or 7 nat 1s in a row.
Locke observes a dozen potatoes cooking meals as he passes the stealth check. They are small (like potatoes) but plentiful. It's also 1am on the clock leaving us an hour left to get out.

We sit down and eat food with a bunch of the small potatoes. They didnt seem to be fond of Tater the Timeless, called him an interloper and seemed to get rather angry when we mentioned him.

The potatoes steal Sebastion. Locke starts talking to Brother the potato. Asks if he wants us to help, remove the interloper issue.
It's strongly alluded that they cook people. Seabastion sees Nern getting roasted on a spike. Camilla links with me and we slowly get up and move to the kitchen. The potates don't notice but they seem to be getting upset with Neil as we leave.

Locke is in a large room that is very hot, floors isnt lava. There are some levers, wheels and a cylinder with chains affixed to the wheels.

Neil beings putting the potatoes in a trance and Camilla and I are waiting in the kitchen. The interloper must be kept safe, it is their entire purpose. Neil jumps towards us and is going to bring all atention to us in the kitchen. Samaroth takes the same door as Locke and.

The kitchen people get back and cock a potato bomb we are going to nuke them as they come in. They are held back by a flame wall made with oil and a match. Samaroth and Locke are looking at a forge type room.

Camilla and I miss our potato throw. And we prep to use some aoe.

Bit -> Camilla -> Horde of Taters -> Neil

I cast Arms of Hadar twice for 9 & 5 dmg. I am at 5 hp and may die next turn.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> RULE DECISION
> Ignite dmg ticks on start of opponent turns. Meaning that it perma aggros the person who cast it if it needs to make a decision.

Locke and Samaroth manage to smash the potato giant and kill it with `99+2` points of damage. The rest of us are still fighting the hordes of potatoes.

We all follow the way Locke and Samaroth went. We all follow the portal into a large bedroom. Large laboratory looking bedroom.

We free the wizard and we end up on the porch of the werehouse. Wizard said we would get `10 platinum` pieces each for freeing him.
Camilla's father was a part of treasure divers (graverobbers)
Starch Wizard offers to help Camilla with her speach. Taterthorn the Timeless. He gives us 10 platinum each. Taterthorn wants to free Waard (werehouse)
Hes giving us a personal item: `Burlap Sack: Taterthorns Bag of Infinite Finite potatoes.`
> Once a day you can pull out a small amount of potatoes worth 5 camping supplies. Regular potatoes & they dont explode.
`Teleportation Circles`: You have to learn teleport spell and use it for fast travel / waypoint. (lv 4 spell)

Library of Silence sometimes the library has a knack for showing you things that you need to know... something that could help or warn or benefit you or not.

Library of Silence sometimes the library has a knack for showing you things that you need to know... something that could help or warn or benefit you or not.

# Episode 9: The Road Back

Teleported out of the lava-room into a dining hall. Fought some sentient potatoes that cooked Nyrn alive. Lock fought the big tater with Samaroth. The rest of us fought the tater swarms. Busted Taterthorn paying us all 10plat pieces. He wants us to cure Waard and Camilla spoke to him of the ring. We long rested at Taterthorns place.

We begin our travels back to where we came from.

1. We travel the first day and a `14` roll gets us a normal sunny day. Night went without a hitch.
2. We travel with a `4` - everything appears normal. Somehow we slept in a way where it fixed the clock so it is morning.
    - We move into a clearing. Off in the distance there is a winding dirt trail with a cart being towed. There are two figures one short one taller, covered carts are near them. They are traveling in the direction we are headed.
    - During the day I found 8 unidentified berries while traveling. Unsure if they are good or not. Rolled a `10` for it.
    - Night time: Camilla Rolled `10` and night went fine.
3. Neil `20nat`, with high morale we were able to cut half a day off our travel time.
    - I find 6 more unidentified berries of the same type.
    - Another night without anything crazy

3-4 hours before we get to the city.

Neil asks me about the spellbinder society. We approach the city that we came from. Less people are around fewer shops, some are closed down mid day and a heavier Dravenguard precence in the city. there are Imperia guards as well. We make our way to the very crowded Lawmasters office.

Random civilian Haggus. Wants Ren Quilf?

Issac and Doug the guards let us in like famous people. The inside of the lawmasters office is filled with Dravenguard. Lawmaster comes out and sees us.

We see Seraphine as Tyrion leads us to Renly. Seraphina is not looking good - bandaged and injured.

Tyrion Vouches for us.
I told you all I follow strict rules. Thr woman who taught me is the lawmaster of stonemarsh and all cities within the merchant coast. Lawmaster Ozen the Immovable. Hot headed.

Tyrion does not send word of our arrival.

Renly pays us `36 gold`

Back in Brickshire -

2 gold for 4 nights (.5g a night)
I bought 10 gold for 20 days
I bought a small straight iron piece for `Hold Person` - 1g

I went over to the stables to figure out horsing prices and estimated time to Stonemarsh. Rolled a `21` persusaion to convince the stable people.

#### Horse Numbers

2 week trip (4wk round)
2 Horses + Carriage
Rent: 75g + 20g back at any location
Buy: 120g

Discuss horse travel vs by boat.

# Episode 10: By Land or Sea

We decided on the name `The Initiative`

6 day journey by boat in exchange for work.

Samaroth purchased `44` gold shoes, Camilla got Seabastion shoes for `3` gold with a `6` gold shipping fee. To be shipped to the courier service in Stonemarsh

Neil and I head to the docks to dicuss the details with the captain of the ship we may be a part of: The Maiden Voyage.
Captain Brock

Neil was the first man of the Pliothea Gazer

it is `10`gold a pet but free to travel with our work and we leave tomorrow morning.

Samaroth reads some of Taterthorns personal notes regarding Waard - Waard doesn't seem to think his condition is a curse or disease. The second book is ancient, yellow brittle pages and as he flipps through the book is damaged by the elements. The words are rather sparse and there just seems to be random scribbles and drawings. On the spine the only words are **When Death Marches**.

Camilla is going to go feed on people but the group doesn't know that as we failed our `insight` checks while Camilla passed her `deception` check.

Neil notices taht Camilla just walked out the front.

Camilla stealths and is awaiting a person to hunt. Finds a younger woman 16-17 years of age and looks elven. Camilla casts darkness in the alley as the woman passes by and grapples her and starts draining her of blood.

As the scream happens Neil with a `nat 20` jumps out the window to figure out where the screaming is.

Camilla is sated and begins to hear voices in the entrance of the alley way. Dravenguard are looking into the events of the screaming at this time. Camilla tries to knock out the woman and misses terribly `nat 1`. At this point it looks like Neil is going to approach and Camilla is going to get caught in the act. Neil runs into the darkness and looks for the woman touches Camilla and begins to levitate them out of the darkness. Sebastion tells Neil that he needs to heal this and places Neil's hand on the neck of the woman. Camilla takes too long to make a decision and the guards move in and grab the woman and attempt to grab Camilla but miss terribly. Neil and Neil being to float upward without the woman. As Camilla and Neil break out of the top of the darkness an alarm bell is being rung. As they get to the top of the roof Neil tells Camilla to push him off the roof.

As the bell sounds I go to find Neil as he tends to get himself into odd situations everywhere we go. Lock goes to find an abandoned home to light on fire to distract people from the incident. The guards flood out of the lawmaster's office, and scream to lock the city down. The Imperia (Federal police) guards are now out on the prowl. I start heading North with the smoke cloud that is not suspiciously at all moving across the rooftops.

An Dravenguard (state police) guard picks Neil up and gives a super rigtheous speach about how the law will prevail. They all know that it's a vampire and the guard instructs Neil to come with him and puts Neil on his shoulder. The guard's name is Frederick.

Camilla spots a sewer hole 90 feet away. The guards see Camilla (they have torches). An Imperia guard that is a balding mage begins to cast a `Firebolt` and misses from a far distance.
I convert my staff to a snake and it slithers around his feet and seems distracted. I can control the snake from 60 feet and as long as I convert it before it dies my staff is fine. Worst case I will need to replace my staff.
Frederick is oddly nice to Neil and is the most rigtheous human on earth. He yells "I have a boy from the incident". The lady speaks softly "Put him in the containment chamber with the others".

Oscar takes great concern with Neil's missing father.

The snake takes 6 points of damage - 60 hp total.

Camilla went into the sewers and I turn around and recall my snake.My plan is to recall the snake in a 'long' way and then have him go into the bag of holding.
Camilla is moving through the sewers.

Neil is in the holding cell and the lady in there is scared that they are going to kill her for potentially being infected. Neil gives up trying to talk to the woman as she is hysterical.

The door eventually opens for Neil as Tyrion Faust is in the doorway and instructs Neil to follow him outside the cell by name.

Tyrion says "It's unfortuate to see you're tied up in this, where are your friends?".

Neil gives a recount of the recent events from his point of view.

Neil offers to heal the people and he is instructed to wait where he is.

As Bit is walking away he recalls his snake holding the magical hat of holding by dipping it down as the snake slithers in.

Bit, Lock, and Samaroth regroup in the tavern and discuss the next steps. Bit predicts that the smoke cloud was Camilla as she is the only companion missing at the moment. We plan to wait in the tavern and wait for the lawmaster's men to come and get us. We don't plan to try and locate Camilla as we just hope she will end up on the boat if she still wants to venture with us.

#### Camilla

Camilla is moving through the sewers and finds and opening that seems like a service room: midevil equivalent to a janitors closet.
Finds a strange shiny amulet on the couch in the service room, on the amulet and seems to be religious in nature. She sees the siloutte of a figure. Somone must have left this here, it's not likely Camilla is alone.

Camilla calls out into the sewer. Someone responds with a moan and the previous tapping noise in the sewer stops.

Camilla out of fear says "If you need information I can make it worth your while". The persons say "I can't see it anywhere".

*Camilla thinks they may be looking for that amulet*

Camilla says "If I can stay for the night I will pay handsomely" while moving away quickly. She begins to hear groups of guards down here converging on her position.

All of a sudden she feels two hands coming out of the walls made of stone and a face appears and he says "One night?" "Yes" "Alright 30 gold" "Okay take me out of here"

Camilla is then pulled through the wall and is in the hallowed out room within the sewer and there is an undergroup village looking thing and the the earth guy says: "Alright when the guards leave we will continue". Many people in the room have tools and they may be contributing to this undergroup living conditions.

#### Bit and co

We get a knock at the door and are instructed to go to the Lawmasters office.
We get there and we find Neil there with Tyrion Faust who told Neil to go grab his things. He wonders if we saw anything and Samaroth gives a long winded story. He tells us that we should leave as too many things are happening poorly as we have been here. We rest at the inn and prepare to leave in the morning.

#### Camilla

After being pulled into the hidden area. The workers seem filthy, everyone else seems rather normal. This room is massive and carved out to be some sort of underground cavern. There are smaller structures within the space.

"Pay up" the man in the wall says. Camilla gives over the coin requested. "Speak to Cederic, he will get you hooked up" he says as he phases back into the wall.

Cederic finds Camilla and explains that she has found herself (and Sebastion) in trouble. He asks for more money for Sebastion and Sebastion rebuttles with "well a smaller price for a smaller body". This kid laughs and says to cut them some slack.

The kid who spoke out has tattoos of symbols over his arms, has a redish leather chest piece. "You're just staying here a day?"

"Just a day"

"You'll be gone in the morning"

"Of course"

...

"Thanks for the help!" Camilla says to the kid.

Camilla was shut down quickly and the kid is rather harsh with his response.

### Next Day

#### Bit and co

As Lock wakes he unclenches his hand and dropps a coin of Destin that was not originally in his posession. He picks it up and identifies that there is a picture of Destin on one side the other side is worn down.

We begin walking towards the pier to board the ship.

#### Camilla

Cederic is at a table smoking a pipe and as Camilla approaches she wonders where the man in the wall: BAALG is.
Cederic walks over and wakes BAALG up.

"Send this one back through, her time is done"

Camilla gets pulled back out into the sewers. Casts `invisibility` and heads over to the docks. See's her party and begins to sneak on the boat while invisibible. No one see's her as she heads below deck and hides behind some cargo. Overhears some people below deck and they are assessing the number of guests.

#### Everyone

Captain Brock addresses everyone and collects payment for pets.
Neil super stubbornly pays for Camilla's pet despite her not being here.

Four other crewmembers:

First Mate: Morwyn (Dwarf)

Deckhands: Argus (Human), Gwendalyn (Dwarf Female), Iver (Goblin)

As we get on the ship we are informed that we will all be working, confirms that we are to be dropped off on Stonemarsh. If anything happens we are getting thrown over the boat as long as we are involved.

*there is one central ballista*

Locke, Samaroth, and Bit are going to be in charge of rearranging their inventory below deck. We have to do their paperwork essentially and document all their things.

We begin to set off and Camilla is no longer invisibile. We recount what happened with her as Morwyn walks downstairs. As he notices Camilla he pulls out his sword and points it at her questioning who it is. Brock gets mad at her being here and getting on magically. It seems like he is very anti magic. Camilla begins to work with us.

### Travel Begins

#### Day 1 : Rolled `6`

No obstructions we go along clearly

Locke heads over to Argus to inquire about the ballista and who operates it. It seems everyone has basic knowldege of the ballista and how to operate it.
Locke begins to advocate for himself as a weapon fanatic.
He asks Argus to take a look at the weapon he has been inventing.
Locke wants to test a sThe Bells

> Finished up some stuff in Stonemarsh and met with Ozen to accept two bounties that lead to the party escorting one of the Goldhearts to an exotic animal deal that left the party in quite the predicament where they were turned on by the very party they were doing business with.

The episode begins with combat as Jaba's limp body hits the ground and the masked guards that turned on him looks to leave no witnesses.

Camilla -> Kragen -> Bit -> Neil -> Guard A -> Guard B -> Locke

> If the spell has no visual effect (ie. Mind Spike/Blast) if the caster is already stealthed the caster can roll for stealth again post spell cast to remain stealthed.

mokebomb on the ship. Argus doesn't seem to have any issues with that.

Neil goes to speak with Morwyn at the navigation table below deck. He opens up with "how long have you been sailing" and they exchange years of experience. Morwyn seems to think that the Pliothea is going somewhere around Shadow Spire Isle doing some government sanctioned work.
Treadfang is easier to talk to than Brock, Morwyn says they will talk more tonight.

Samaroth is approaching Iver the goblin. Iver is located at the top of the post and he is looking through a telecsope. Samaroth says he doesn't spend too much time on the seas. He inquires about the common creatures and foes of the seas. Iver says there aren't many pirates or monsters this close to the coast but out deep there are more perilous foes. Iver has been part of the crew for two years and then gets a little agitated.
The goblin has a little sparkle in his eye (first disaster?). Some of them turned civilized during this disaster. Basically allows them to become more normal humaniod.

During this day Camilla chooses to stare at the open sea and takes in the fresh air.

Bit works overtime and doesn't take a break, slowly but he is putting in the time. Some take minor notice but nothing to be proud of.

#### Night 1

Everyhing is still calm and it is cold. There is a little fire going and we all are beginning to feel the effect of the Fall season.
We are all gathered before it before bed. The captain begrungenly says "I guess you lot didn't have a terrible first day".

"You lot deserve a drink" he mutters as he uncorks a bottle.

Neils drink of choice is milk. Then Morwyn offers him a swig of liquor. He keeps it down without a flinch as the captain chuckles in satisfaction.

Neil then asks about pirate stories and references the story called *The Revenanat's Revenge*.

Morwyn's story is about a man who traveled to Shadow Spire himself. Before people went there to make a name for themselves. Morwyn heard "that himself and five other men rowed in on a boat and desperate for supplies they scavanged the desolate island for supplies. Only fungus and little nutrients were alive. They then found an oasis deep beneath the rocks there was an untapped source of greens and riches not seen before. A whole new ecosystem beneath it's surface. I don't know if any of it is true but I heard it."

They try and dig some stories out of Bit...

Bit then passes the bottle to Camilla and Sebastion gets questioned as to why Camilla cannot talk and he asks for disenchantment spells in response.

Camilla passes the bottle to Samaroth who gets complemeneted for his nice shoes.
Samaroth claims to not have any experiences then mentions that he is a bounty hunter.
He's then threatened to be thrown overboard. So he rambles a story about his father who was also a bounty hunter named Jerimiah Zekley.
The captain seems to recall the Zekley name but cannot remember what he remembers it from.
Samaroth then goes into a story about his first bounty and it is basically for gold.

Locke now has the bottle. He has been traveling 5 weeks. And before that he had been a tavern brawler. His father was at the battle of the burning keep, a nobody soldier is what he describes him as.
Locke avoided the army due to bad blood and betrayal. Locke was fighting for his little brother who is afflicted by sightrot (Demon Slayer master).

The battle of the burning keep was a hell hole, with flames buringing as far as the eye can see. The captain hasn't had to be called into war by the king.
The captain thinks the king is going to get us all in trouble. Locke thinks the kings should fight eachother.

Twin Irons: two of the kings most efficient generals during the war.
Any time there was a big fight that needed to be won the Twin Irons would show up. General Ferrick and the Demon of Duskar.
Lockes father has seen General Ferrick a few times. Lock's dad said Ferrick was betrayed by his own men. It's said that the king was scared of Ferrick's eyes so he had him assassinated.

Battle of the burning keep was the last battle on Dayin soil. Two years before the war ended.

The ship and it is crew are an independant vessel.

#### Night Watch

Neil notices a small bird that has blue coloration and is mostly black. The bird lands on the railing.

#### Day 2 : Rolled `8`

Morning comes and we are greeted by a crimson red sunrise.

> Red sun at night sailor's delight, red sun at morning sailor take warning.

Today we are scrubbing the deck until they are spotless. The storm starts coming. As the it does the clouds take place in the skies and a light rain begins.

Suddenly the storm comes on us. The waves are getting massive and tossing the ship around. We hear a snapping pole noise as we see one of the ropes of the main sail beginning to snap.
Neil goes to mend the pole and does it with ease.

As the storm continues Iver screams "THERE'S A LIGHT IN THE WATER".

The crew is then instructed to arm the ballista. So it is assumed this thing is dangerous.

Samaroth peers over the back of the ship and sees nothing. We begin to hear a high pitched noise from below the ship.
Combat begins.

On the rear of the ship there is a winged creature and jelly fish creatures that appear.

> Bit -> Locke -> ~~Jellyfish~~  -> Maverick -> ~~Stingray~~ -> Camilla -> Neil -> Crewmates -> ~~Sea Creature Thing~~ -> ~~Tentacruel Dude~~

Bit fires magic missles a lot to destroy a Jellyfish, Locke and the captain team up on another Jellyfish while the Stingray attempts blows on Samaroth missing most of the time.
The Stingray goes down to a massive hit by Samaroth with Oshiek. Locke and Camilla move over to the Sea Creature Thing with Gwendalyn already there preparing her attack.

Neil fires a marble critically at the Sea Creature Thing. Following that hit the ballista critically fires at the Sea Creature Thing and it is ripped in half as its body falls to the deck.

The Tentacruel conjures some mist around it right around Bit, he stumbles back and avoids the effects of the mist. Bit reacts by blasting the creature with `Dissonant Whispers` causing it to run away in fear.

Camilla throws a dart and misses the Tentacruel. Neil casts `Guiding bolt` at it and critically hits it out of existance.

The storm continues but the enemies are defeated. Eventually the storm dies down as the night settles in.

#### Night 2

First mate complements Neil for that crit. Wondering if hes going to sail with his father one day.

We all long rest and Neil takes watch after Iver. He perceives the calm seas and appreciates the view.

#### Day 3 Roll: `2`

The weather is fair this morning, bright sky and a few passing clouds. Water is much calmer as well compared to the previous day. The day continues without anything noticible until a cluster of birds flying above the water are off in the distance. Iver yells "Captain! It looks like a wrecked ship nearby. By the sandbars!"

Captain: "Gwendalyn go up top and stear me in the right direction"

Todays work will be more fun for us. The ship slows as we approach shallower waters. The ship we can see got caught in the sandbar as it is pearched. It seems to be a shipping vessel at least double the size of our ship. Most of it is completely submerged. Today's work is to loot that ship of any supplies.

Bag of holding doesn't allow me to stick my head in for air which is unlucky. I wonder if there are any ways to abuse the air in the bag of holding.

I have 6 (5 + const bonus) minutes of breath.

Boat's name is the Crimson [Boat Name]

Samaroth and Bit search the captains quarters and don't find much besides some carving by a chained man that says *balance is restored*.

Neil is heading toward the surface at the first sign of distress. Yells to the captain saying there is some monster down in the ship.

Camilla went to search for a hole in the bottom of the ship. Finds a similar light in the bottom of the ship. After finding that she returns to the hull.

Bit and Samaroth go to the hole in the hull and open up a barrel of 20 ballista rounds and a barrel of nothing.

Neil gets back to Camilla and Locke and Neil tries to sign to Camilla. Some weird agreement is reached via this communication.

Bit and Samaroth open another barrel and Samaroth is hit by one of the poisonious shot. We leave with the barrel of ballista rounds. We then return to the ship.

Neil assertains that the poison will not be good if left alone.

#### Night 3

Nothing eventful - Neils takes watch at the top of the crow's nest. All is quiet until he hears a flapping noise and see's the same black based bird with strange blue feathers. Lands up on the top of a sail. The bird's eye has a feint blue glow to them.

#### Day 4 Roll: `3`

Very strong wind blows in our favor as we travel. We reduce the trip by one whole day due to this wind.  Galescar we know to be the largest northern city in Daein. Morwyn and Bit have a conversation and we hit it off. Out of game Bit has caught a gay dwarf fetish.

Our work for the day that storm apparently ruined the supplies that we had already organized. I sprint ahead to grab a clipboard and begin taking inventory so I don't have to do as much lifting. Neil gets to steer the ship.

#### Night 4

Bit and Gwendalyn get to talking around the fire pit. Mindless night time chatter ensues.

Neil takes watch again and nothing happens.

#### Day 5 Roll: `5`

The ship pulls up next to a pile of rubbish floating in the water. Climbing down Argus reaches down and grabs what looks to be a shirtless human with tattered pants, his skin is burnt by the sun.
He is thrown on the deck and the captain asks, "What do you guys think?".

He still seems to be breathing and we bring him into our sleeping quarters. The man who is balding and seems middle aged based on what we can see. He has scarring all over and he is well built. A tattoo on his arm which no one recognizes except Locke. A symbol of the Red Balance.
Locke speaks to the captain and he seems to know about the group. They are a criminal or mafia type organization based out of Dravenhold.

The Red Balance have been gaining numbers recently. The captain has never seen them on the waters before. But it doesn't surprise him as they have been making more bold moves outside of Daein.

We are discussing whether or not to kill him. The captain asks what they would do on the Gazer to Neil. He discusses that he would see if he has a bounty and make a move based on that.

We decide to bind him and if there is a reward we can turn him in for the reward. Otherwise he dies before we get to port.
This discussion takes a really long time as we discuss morals of this person.

Neil works on picking him up via `Spare the Dying` and other means. We wave Samaroth's pungent foot powder in front of this guys nose. He seems to wake up from that and Neil gives him water and some bread.

Camilla asks the man why he was abandoned at sea.

"My sea capsized in a storm two days ago" the man says.

Nero is the man's name.

Neil asks where the man was headed.

"I was headed south... thundercoast, to see family"

"Did your ship have a name"

"Not sure it wasn't my ship I was just a passenger, traveling alone there were others but not with me"

Bit cast `Detect Thoughts`

Surface Level: I can't believe someone found me... I hope they don't know.

Digging Deeper: I see a memory of the ship in the storm and something is breaking off and a mast punctures the ship. Ship itself starts to fall a part. Another memory of him looking at a list of towns: ~~Tidecrest~~, ~~Ashport~~, ~~Stonemarsh~~, Stormgarden.

"All right, I work with the Red Balance..."

"We know from your tattoo"

"I'm looking for someone... "

"Who..., I'll go back looking"

"I'm charged with finding a half orc with the last name Ironjaw. He has gone by a few names. It's thought his original name was Creed."

At this point we see smoke coming above deck and Gwendalyn is screaming about it.

Bit travels to the main deck to check it out with Samaroth. Neil and Camilla stay behind to keep an eye on the prisoner Nero.

Neil defends against the hit and frame perfect blocks Locke's strike. "Step out of the way boy" exclaims Locke.

The smokebomb is thrown over the ship and at this point people start coming back down.

Camilla during the commotion takes this chance to feed on Nero as he is unable to resist.

At this time we see what is happening below deck. Camilla is mid feast and Locke has a weapon pulled on Neil with his eyes glowing.

The captain lines us up and we are trying to plead our case. I silent cast `Calm Emotions` and the captain saves against it. He wants us to sleep above deck tonight. The captain then drives his dagger into the throat of Nero.

We have no duties and we sleep grouped up above deck being watched attentively.

#### Night 5

Camilla and Iver have a heart to heart during the Night

#### Arrival Day

We get to the city long rested and we are to dock in an hour. The captain seems a bit more distant than before.

# Episode 11: The City of Stonemarsh

This is a large city which can lead to longer travel times between places within compared to Brickshire.

We go to locate the Dockmaster, who resides in a two story building. We see what seems to be a two hour line leading up to the front door. A chunky gray dragonborne asks us what we are here for and what our ship name was.

Neil begins to ask about the Pliothea the dragonborne doesn't seem to believe that Neil is the son of the first mate. However with a two gold bribe he is easily convinced. He then explains that the Pliothea is expected to return within the week. They are going to dock at the largest port because it is the only one they can fit in.

He then points us in the direction in the nearest tavern which is in the Sira district: right through the main gate not far on our left there will be a tavern named *The Immovable Mug*

The group begins walking through the open gates of Stonemarsh. As we enter the Sira district it feels much like Brickshire. Watch towers litter the district with Dravenguard manned on them in order to keep the peace. Many of the commonfolk approach trying to trade with us as we walk in. The people are very diverse and the economic status seems to be middle-class here.

#### Bit and Samaroth

We reach The Immovable Mug just before noon. The tavern is massive that has a balcony that wraps around.

1 room 5 nights = 9 gold. Which Samaroth attempts to swindle and gets it for 7 gold.

4th floor room 408.

Bounty boards are on the second floor of the tavern. As we make our way up there the second floor gives off a totally different feel.
Most of the people appear to be adventurers or mercinaries.
They are all probably looking to complete bounties themselves.

As we get to the board we see some simple ones like guard jobs and labor. The more interesting ones read things like: 'Need hands to capture magical creatures' and 'paying those with any information on the breakthrough on the Goldheart family murders'.
One reads: 'wanted Rowin Blackthorn' which pays 5000 gold alive, 2000 dead.

Private investigator for mysterious disapearance of a shopkeep - no posted reward.

We take the `Rowin Blackthorn` and `Goldheart family murder` bounties along with the `Private Investigator` one.

`Goldheart Family Murders`: Farlander freelancer paying for this the Eldis district is where we will have to go. This is the center of the city. The name of the client is Everen Vander.

`Rowin Blackthorn`: Allegedly escaped war criminal from Stonemarsh dungeons. Deserter from Daein Crimea war. Made an escape and we are tasked with finding him. Lawmaster is located in the Eldis district.

`Shopkeep disapearance`: Shopkeep in the Zorin district. This one doesn't surpise him that much. Many jobs of theft and violence from that district it is the slums.

#### Locke

Finds another half orc that is carrying a large basket on his back and Locke approaches with a 'howdy brother'.

"I'm looking for a tinkerer"

"A tinkerer? You mean like gears? ... Near the gates of the Eldis district there is a tinkerer with a little shop"

He travels to the gates where he finds a place called *Gizmo's Gearworks*.
It doesn't look very busy so he approaches switly.
As he opens the door it emits a loud creak and as he enters a large explosion takes place a puff of dust occurs.

"What can I do you for" Gizmo asks.

"I'm looking for a tinkerer and heard this may be the place."

"That it is, what're you here for Locke?"

"I've got a shopping list but I was hoping you could tell me what the best materials would be for the set of blueprints I have here would be."

As Locke asks he looks around and notices that the place is an absolute dump.

Locke hands over *The Night's Fall* and he begins to squint with intent at the blueprint.

"Where did you get this?"

"I drew it up myself"

"This is pretty good work, but I do see a few flaws."

"What are your pointers?"

"I may be able to help but... I'm awefully busy right now maybe if you help me I'll help you out?" he says. "I've got a few commissions for the day and I could use some help."

"Not only will I help you out, but I'll be here for some time and whenver I have some free time I will work for free."

"Work for free? Why would you do that?"

"Well, my whole life I've only been good at fighting and my mother wanted more for me so it is time to move that into action".

"I supposed it does get lonely around the shop."

"Who are you going to tell your jokes to"

"I wouldnt want to deprive you of my humor... I had that same drive once when I was younger." he says "you can stop by whenever."

They then go into talks about the potato bombs to which Gizmo has a special room for testing that kind of experimentation.

Locke then inquires about the cost of the materials that he needs.

Potato Bomb: 4 gold total - without assembly

Locke will be back tomorrow to see Gizmo.

#### Neil and Camilla

Camilla questions an ancient man for the deatils on where the blacksmith may be. He falls asleep mid conversation then once awoken he points to the direction of the blacksmith.

The building is named *Forged in Fire*

Plate armor was priced at 1500 gold. Which is far above what Neil was willing to pay.

Camilla looks for some throwing weapons.

Thowing daggers are priced at 50 gold a piece.

*Kreels Charms and Arms* is the name of the Enchanter.

Eldis has a much larger military precence.

#### Bit and Samaroth

Connecting the towers are a network of magic chondalas.

We go to the lawmasters building.
Looking for Ozen The Immovable

Brad the Dravenguard greets us. And goes to relay the message to Ozen the Immovable. She wishes to have a meeting with us at 5am tomorrow.

Rowin Case:

Last seen a week ago at the very edge of the Norn district (northern section outside the city walls).

Rowin is a veteran of the war, experienced fighter, served in Ozen's troop. Rowin is pushing 50 as a half-elf. Mighty fine with a bow and stealth tactics.

Don't piss her off.

Nonsense: Perhaps he has said too much, look to question Ozen about this Nonsense.

We head over to Everen Vander to give information regarding the Goldheart murder.

#### Locke

The shop is littered with plenty of unfinshed and experimental items that Gizmo was aprobably working on.
Gizmo makes some excuses about being in the process of finishing some stuff up. But he wants Locke to look at a few in particailar. He has a unique job here that was comissioned to him by a wizard type Stonemarsh arcanum. Looks like a chunk of amber not well carved.
There is something floating in the chunk looking frozen in time. Tehre was a mishap in the spires and apparently there was a piece of oracalcum go unstable. One of them was able to freeze it here in this vault of amber and he wants to see if we can make a thing that can contain the oracalcum.

Gizmos  master was the tinkerer for the king himself: Romulus Rhombus.

Romulus Rhombus was an older man already during the war. So now hes very old less than 10 years of life a human. Engineered many of the siege machines that used oracalcum during the war. Used to level Crimean walls.

Galescar is the hub of oracalcum. Stonemarsh is the largest port city of Daein.

War in the south the 'real war'. The same war there has always been us vs. them, man vs. nature.. the wilds.

Locke works through the rest of the day.

#### Camilla and Neil

Are in the Zorin district. These are lower income buildings and a obviously poor part of the city. The Zorin district has a physically lower profile as it's on a low point on the hill.

Propaganda guy is screaming of a guy no one wants to talk about.

They locate Kreels Charms and Arms, as they walk in it is rather clean and there is a little bell that dings.
Tall but slender red skinned hob goblin. Kruga Kreel is his name. (Reminds me of Blarg the red hob goblin that is with Omellum in the Underdark)

Camilla asks about disenchanting the ring she has that is bound to her. The same ring that she was gifted by her family: The Ring of Purgatory. The wearer cannot take it off or speak while wearing it. The wearer can teleport a short (5ft) distance every so often (once per long rest)

The attempt to disenchant it didn't go very well and may kill Camilla if it is forcefully removed.

> The Arcanum are a collection of independant organizations that have specific branches of knowledge regarding arcane arts. They are not afiliated with the government.

Elaina Indigo: Shorter, black curly hair, halfling, comedically large green scepter. Member of the Arcanum for 12-15 years.

A brick is thrown into the shop and is vaporized by an arcane barrier that wasn't previously noticed. He doesn't seem phased by this action.

Cloak of prot and ring of prot = 3500 gold

##### Kreel inventory

- Potion of Gaseous Form- 300g
- Potion of Speed- 400g

Neil: Rope of Entanglement
Samaroth: Robe of the Manta Ray

#### Bit and Samaroth

We end up at a brothel that seems very high end.

Slender elven gentlemen, on mention of Everen Vander the smile disapears. A large man leads us to the stairs to Everens room. Another goliath stands inside the room (penthouse).

We see Everen Vander a very well dressed human. Very wealthy and a little older human. He looks at us and we catch that he has a finely trimmed moustache.

Hes looking for validity of rumors. His family in the seven realms are well off. Hes an invester in the oracalcum exchange. He wants to make a fair system of trade.

Heard rumor of the assassin - oracalcum exchange is being struck by changelings. +1 plat

+1 plat

Changelings are beings from the Fey realm. No wonder why they have business here. No idea what they could have gotten wrapped up with . Somehting else is that there appears to be in recent docs from fey realm visits. There is some conflict in the Fey realm. Fall of the veil may have caused this.

Stonemarsh Arcanum is where to go to learn more about mages. He shows us where. Different spires different great wizard.

#### Everyone back to the Tavern

Bit and Samaroth try to lie about the bounty reward. Bit wants to take the job but it is a long journey.

Everyone but Bit gives 25 gold to hold their items from the enchanter.

Bit sleeps while they are at the enchanters place.

Bit is looking to go to the Arcanum spirals to inquire about the spellbinder society alone tomorrow after the talk with the lawmaster and before noon when we are supposed to meet those that want to go to do the bounty.

The bounty may be a bad idea but it's the only real way for us to get any resonable money for these magic items. Otherwise there is no way for us to aquire them from what I can tell.

Locke sells his `Basalisk Oil` for 300 gold. Neil and Locke go privately to show him something because thats not suspicious at all.

> It seems everyone really wants everyone to just get along without any real building and stuff. Just asking and wanting the party to stay together till the end and I understand the logistics get difficult but it would be super cool to allow the freedom.

> Bit is a solo adventurer that has been alone for a long time and doesn't trust easily but gives off a trusting feel due to his charismatic nature. He is fond of Dwarves because they are stubbornly trustworthy by nature and he has spent so much time around them they feel more like family than anyone else.

As Neil asks about the spellbinder society a flash comes across his face. He asks 'why', the demenor has changed from Kreel he seems uneasy. "You dont want anything to do with that lot".

"Just keep your nose out where it doesn't belong" he is very hesitatnt to speak about this group.

Jasper is the kid in the Kreel shop

Kreel asked where his food was and they offered 2 potatoes some jerky and a serving of milk. He does seem impressed by the size of the potatoes.

# Episode 12: The Simple Transaction

Ozen the Immovable

Today is the 9th of Tyros

#### Neil Samaroth and Bit

Neil, Samaroth, and Bit head out to see Ozen the Immovable at 5am. Neil suffers a point of exaustion due to the early wake up time.

Why does coffee not counter exaustion?

We make it through the Eldis district gates and we approach the doors to the lawmaster's office. Bit pounds the door till someone opens it and peers out.

We all sit down in the waiting area. Ozen's office door eventually opens. A young elven man appears before us, he has traditional longer hair and soft features. A single decrative sword at his side. He identifies himself as Oscar Pilt, Bit introduces the part that accompanied him.

We are ushered in as Ozens impantient voice comes booming from the office 'Let them in!'.

The office space is large but minimal as you would except a lawmaster's office to be. At one end of a large table Ozen stands and looks angry by nature. She wears official Daein robes with gaws wrapped down her forearms.

Tyrion Faust from Brickshire

Questions:
Any info on the bounty we are currently working towards.

- Rowen bounty for a lot of money

We explain that we helped with the Goldheart case

He served with Ozen back in the war. He was an alright soldier till he one day deserted. "Any reason" Samaroth asks.

He never gave one, it is assumed hes a paranoid coward. That had strange dreams.

I imagine he would try to hit up old war time buddies. No one connected to her as they would all turn him in. She suggests to start looking at the capital. All the armies are gathering there. She has no knowledge on his dreams contents. She could get us the doctors names. 5000 gold bounty is a reward from the city.

She's heard of the spellbinder society. She suggests going to the Arcanum to futher inquiry Elaina Indigo.

Reward talk: The 5000 gold is a reward from the city, she will personally pay an additional 2500 gold pieces upon him being brought back alive. total is now 7500 gold pieces if alive.

Neil wants to learn more about the wearabouts of his mom. Oscar will give him info. It's then that someone throws the door open impantiently.

The dwarf is exceptionally wealthy and put together. He begins screaming at Ozen who complains saying that she is rather movable. He pushes forward and seems to be upset about a lack of guarding being provided.

Stonemarsh menagerie, 5pm tonight. The job starts at 6pm. He walks out calling Ozen a pain in the ass. ozen seems a bit... pissed.

Marcus May, is the name of the dwarf. A local highroller, that uses his wealth to push people around. He collects creatures and mysterious creatures from across the realm.

Ozen owes Marcus an expensive favor. We will be making 7500 for the body guard job. We are to protect him during a transaction that he is having with another collector.

We conclude the conversation by 630am. Oscar gives a letter to Neil with some information regarding his mother allegedly.

#### Locke and Camilla

Have a weird conversation about ninjas?

Camilla has a strange excuse for being MIA all day and Locke threatens to exclude her from the 5000 reward for the Rowin bounty. They keep referring to Camillas undead hunger as 'the bathroom break'.

Locke heads to the tinkerer - Gizmos

Camilla goes to the docks to.. catch a fish?

#### Locke

Gizmo is right where he left him. Locke sneaks up on him and scares him half to death as he screams in the shop.

"We got a big day to day" Gizmo exclaims. "We didn't get to something I wanted to talk to you about yesterday, could we get to that?" Locke questions.

"Could we work on the potato bomb?" Locke

Gizmo: "Well as I was saying, "

They look for a casing for the potato bomb, and Locke comes across a great casing for the job. Gizmo returns with many springs and a welder in his hand. As hes sorting through stuff "well were taking a look at something rather unique later today. Military type, government work ya'know. Im supposed to take a look at an apparatus they found and figure out what it does and what makes it tick."

As Gizmo works despite his mental ability waining his muscle memory shows the vast experience he has in the industry of engineering.
Gizmo gives Locke everything he needs to get the job done and requests the Locke do the actual work or else he wouldnt learn anything.

#### Camilla

Camilla heads to the oldest aged fisherman at the docks. Who has an emblem of retired veteran status. He asks for his meds as he notices the cat speaking to him. Camilla looks to buy the fish off him. Camilla pays 5 silver for two fish and the man turns around and walks to the pub with the silver as she hands him the money.

Camilla hides while eating a fish. A barrel pops open while she is feasting and she tries to disguise that she was ever feasting on the raw fishs blood. As she finishes she asks the kid why he is hiding in that barrel. The kid's name seems to be Jack as someone is screaming that name and the kid begins to hide again.

Camilla begins to head towards the slums of the city and looking for some 'no good doers'.

#### Bit, Samaroth, and Neil

We head to stonemarsh arcanum. There are gates and we are let in. It looks like a massive park with different spires in the city.
Bit asks a random stranger where Elaina Indigo is, she is in the Indigo spire. He summons a portal and we step through it to get to the indigo spire.

Samaroth and Bit cast mage hand and try to knock on the window. The door to the balcony opens up and someone who just woke up walks out. We wait 10 minutes for the lady to let us in and she appears through a door magically created. I pocket a breath mint that was conjured before us. We walk into the door and the interior is huge and nothing is proportional. There is a large library with a rollarcoaster and its just chaotic.

Indigo shows a level of recognition when the Spellbinder Society is mentioned. She also seems rather fond of Kreel.

I ask for a name for the Spellbinder Society, she doesn't know one but Garrett Quindry he is her boss, he is the voice of the arcanum.

#### Locke

As someone approaches the door Gizmo straighets up. They apporach and they request to see thir hands. Imperia guards are inside the shop and what looks to be someone at a high rank is the one speakng to Gizmo. He requests that they get it as soon as possible. They begin to rip the door off to the building to get the item inside the office.

A familiar voice is heard when the item is lifted and they pull in what looks to be this enormous automaton. Carrying the backside is the Demon of Duskar. Dressed in now Imperia armor and patches. As he passes by he locks eyes with Locke and says 'well fuck me...'

#### Camilla

'Where could one find dirty work around here' Camilla asks to a random man on the street in code as 'I caught fish, would you like to buy them'. The man says 'no' and doesn't seem to understand the secret code that Camilla tried to use.

Camilla tries to question more people and gives up as she begins to walk back to where she came.

#### Locke

They haul the automaton into the back of the workshop. It seems rather injured, some areas are crushed on it. Locke is unable to disertain what could have done this.

Shiny silver metal, one of its arms from the elbow onward appears to be a built in sword in place of its hand. Even as an experienced tinkerer this doesn't look like a normal automaton. The guy in charge says "Well Gizmo what do you think, want to play around in its guts for a little while. What do you want me to look for."

Demon of Duskar says that they can trust Locke, something about his face makes him think that. The Demon wants to know what Locke is doing outside of Brickshire, thinks he may be following him.
Duskar wants to get a drink while they are in town, he wants to go to Chan's Drinks in the Zorin. Locke calls the Demon 'not a learned man' ie stupid.

Most of the guns are held in the capital held by the Dravenguard. There are probably some blackmarkets for guns. Locke confirms that is illegal to purchase them. But Gizmo confirms that there is a blackmarket for these guns and he may or may not supply materials to this blackmarket.

Gizmo can work on firearms but he cannot make them.

#### Bit, Samaroth, and Neil

Neil: I was wondering if you could look at a few items and tell me if you know anything about them. Kreel said they were beyond his expertise but they may lead to the wereabouts of my mother.

Elaina: Oh sweet thing what is it?

Neil: Samaroth, Bit, I havent shown you this yet, I know a bit more than I led on she was looking though the fracture. These are her notes on it. One day I heard a boom in the medow where it was located and there was smoke and a random device (places it in Elainas hand) was in my missing mothers place. (it is an ipod with the initals CK)

Neil: It plays music from another world, the message was "they needed help and their world is dying."

Bit: They speak the same language as us?

Neil: They use different terminalogy like "Thunderstruck"

Elaina: I've.. I've.. NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS!!!

She becomes very excited and a large workspace appears.

Elaina: Gods what could this be a secret message from another world??

Neil: Yeah I call it the spark, it told stories in song and metaphor by different people. But the message was the same, their world is being destroyed by monsters.

Elaina: And your mother... that bit is still up in the air huh.

Neil: Im unsure what happened to her. The fracture is still there though. My mother thought it was a magical disaster. Like a closed gateway with energy coming off of it.

Elaina: Can I keep this here? I wont take it a part without you in the room. If I find anything out I will let you know you'll hear from me up here. *points at her head*

Elaina: I will be traveling to Valeria - I should be back in about a month. (really short time to travel that far and back)

Neil asks for collateral for the device. Something of equal sentimental value. She snaps her finger and a cabinet appears next to her. She reaches into the cabinet and retrieves an emblem from her late husband. It was given to her by the Dravenguard after the war as something to remember him by. This is the only thing she had recieved for her husband being in the wars. Neil accepts this collateral and promises that it will be returned safely.

Neil: One more thing if we leave town should I leave word with anyone? We could be gone longer than month.

Elaina: Thats quite alright I have my ways of contacting you.

#### Everyone at the Tavern - Immovable Mug

Bit shares with everyone the changes in the bounty.

Locke shares that someone came into Gizmos shop with a giant automaton. Most of the party knows what these are, not Camilla. automatons are robots.

Locke shares that he is getting drinks with the Demon of Duskar.

We all go to the Cobbler for Samaroth.

The Cobbler is right next to the menagerie and right across from the blacksmiths shop.

#### Menagerie Bodyguard Quest

We make it to the menagerie which is a large dome building. The place is like a museum. We eventually find Marcus, he asks for our names I show that I can speak dwarvish to him.

Neil: have you ever seen a creature like this? Points at Key.

Marcus: I may have.. yeah I think I have, why are you selling? No? Ill take a look for you after this if it goes well otherwise you can fuck off.

We go around back with Marcus to be briefed about our job. There is a closed off field and a wagon with a large reinforced steel crate. Another dwarven man sitting at the helm of the carriage. He looks finely dressed as well.

Other Dwarf: Marcus are you ready?

Marcus: Yes were coming right now. We will be driving slow make sure no one odd approches. We will meet with someone and there will be an exchange and we will be back.

We are meeting with someone known as "The Collector". Which doesn't resonate with anyone particularly. He seems to look like a lizard folk so we know what to expect.

Other Dwarf looks a little more rugged, well dressed but seems to have worked a few days in his life. We begin to travel to the northern forest outside the city. Two hour trip there. Four - Five hour job today.

Other Dwarf's name is Kragen - I ask him his origin region and he begins lauging deeply. Marcus speaks up and announces the rugged man as Kragen Goldheart. Vondal was a cousin of his, they weren't very close. Vondal was allergic to work liked to whore around and just reap the rewards. I warn him about the changelings likelyhood in targeting him.exotic

I link with Neil, he wants to me to detect thoughts while he questions Kragen. I suggest that we see what he says first before we resort to that. I respect the dwarvish, I don't like to pry where I shouldn't.

Neil asks Kragen if he hated Vondal. He didnt hate him but he didn't have much love for him either.

Neil asks when the last time he saw him was. Kragen hasn't seen him in years and actively avoids him and wants nothing to do with him.

Neil: If the family didnt like him spending money without working for it why didnt they cut him off.

Kragen: that would be a bad look no? There are some politics that are at play here. We cant look disfunctional. It took a lot to get to where we are today.

Marcus: Hells, that got a bit dark there. So, whats your group name?

Bit: It's nothing important really ...

Neil: The Initiative

Marcus made his money at the card table gambling. A little luck and all of a sudden you have a lot of money. He says he cheated in order to get all his money. Locke shows him the cheating dice and he offers it for 300 gold to which Marcus declines because he has already invested a lot into this arrangement. Marcus declines politely.

Suddenly we hear a low growl from the wagon.

Kragen: Oh fuck hes waking up.

The wagon stops and Kragen walks to the back. We hear a door open and the groaning fades as he closes and locks the door as Kragen remounts the cart and begins moving again.

There is a Manticore in there.

Marcus: Shes been a lovely girl Esmerelda, I hate to see her go but this is once in a lifetime opportunity. I am trading it for something from the east, from the Farlands. Ive never seen it before but I have nothing from that region yet.

As we approach the designated location Bit and Camilla stealth into nothingness.

Around the other cart there are three people in armor. The armor seems foreign as we approach. The helmet is shaped into a skull.

A very fat man is sitting in a hammock, he is very ostentaciously dressed. Name is Jaba (the Hutt)

As our cart comes to a complete stop Neil hides under the cart and one of their guards step forward. Marcus mumbles, the guards are new.

Guard: Marcus May? We're here for the transaction.

Marcus: We brought the mantiore did you bring your beast?

Jaba: *indistingused language that no one understands sounds similar to giant*

They uncover their cage and we see a large multi legged insect, tan color, scorpion family. (The Scorge)

They unlatch the manticore from our caravan as we begin the exchange. Camilla detects a subtle warning in what Jaba said in his broken common tongue.

Neil spots something on the latch that connects the new cargo to the horses. Marcus then gets us moving along, as Kragen cracks the horses and as soon as that happens there is a flash as a mote of flame explodes about 4ft in the air.

Cart is blow up and we hear the large bug screech as it is now loose on the battlefield.

Jaba is screaming something and the guards in the skull masks kill Jaba and turn their attention to our direction.

# Episode 13: The Bells

> Finished up some stuff in Stonemarsh and met with Ozen to accept two bounties that lead to the party escorting one of the Goldhearts to an exotic animal deal that left the party in quite the predicament where they were turned on by the very party they were doing business with.

The episode begins with combat as Jaba's limp body hits the ground and the masked guards that turned on him looks to leave no witnesses.

Camilla -> Kragen -> Bit -> Neil -> ~~Guard A~~ -> ~~Guard B~~ -> Locke -> Guard C -> ~~Cockroach~~ -> Samaroth

> If the spell has no visual effect (ie. Mind Spike/Blast) if the caster is already stealthed the caster can roll for stealth again post spell cast to remain stealthed.

Notable events during the battle:

- Samaroth did 3 damage
- Camilla has done 0 damage, but rolled 2 nat 20s when it didn't matter
- Bit and Neil went down in the fight
- The Guard C (spellcaster) teleported away.

As we travel back to Stonemarsh with the manticore and the body of the Scorge. Camilla notices a raven with blue misty eyes like Neil did a few nights ago.

Neil begins questioning the statement that Guard C used calling Samaroth 'the dreamer'. Asks about Ky'Mythaa the demon that he is bound to. Ky'Mythaa is related to Samaroth he tries to stumble out and comes out with Ky'Mythaa offers Samaroth power for bounty hunting prowess and in exchange he does bounties on his behalf when requested.

Apparently the homies are just dumping lore. Locke starts talking about the certain deity (Destin - God of Destiny) that he has been praying to and a coin appeared in his hand one day. And as he says that Kragen Goldheart opens his hand and produces the same coin.

As we are 10 minutes out from the city we see a fire in Stonemarsh and fail to percieve where the fire is originating from. As we get to the outskirts of the city we can tell that the fire is coming from the Harbor district. All of the military vessels are untouched, but all the merchant ships are aflame.

We are requested to bring Marcus to Ozen's office in the Eldis district, ignoring the commotion of the Harbor district. The Imperia guard are assembled and the lawmaster's office is swamped with thousands of people. The guards attempt to keep the peace and as we approach we are meeted by Brad the guard and he lets us in without question.

Inside the office is swamped with panicked citizens and Imperia officers. Locke recognizes the man who walked into Gizmos in the office as we stride towards Ozen's office. As we approach Oscar Pilt catches our eye and he is tasked with receiving us. As he takes us we get rooms on the lawmaster, and he gives us the 7,500 gold pieces for completing the task of guarding Marcus and Kragen. We then get led into Ozen's office.

> Each party member gets (7500 / 5) = 1500 gold each.

Kragen tells Ozen we did good work and Ozen meets him with 'Why the hell are you here?'

Kragen: I traveled with them on the ride, we would have been slaughtered if it wasn't for them.

Marus: I'll admit I'm still alive, I'll get better. What the hell happened here Ozen.

Ozen: I... I don't know what I'm allowed to tell you at the moment. But I think we were attacked.

Camilla: I have a theory

Ozen: People are proposing the most

Camilla: I thought a lot on the walk here, most assume it is a terrorist attack but it doesnt seem realistic to do this for terrorist work. It makes more sense to cut off supplies to other places as a reason to attacking the merchant ships.

Ozen: Idk why they attacked only the merchant ships?

Neil: Don't they transfer oracalcum?

Ozen: those are much more protected, there were reports of a few explosions of green color, then fire insued. 7 Ships blew up and 14 total succumb to the flames.

Locke: Any word of the Spellbinder Society causing some problems around here. **gives a rundown of what we know of them** We are under the impression that the changelings are after the Goldhearts for some reason.

Ozen: Well I appreciate your hunch, I will need something tangible in order to assist further. If I can spare any time I can look into the Spellbinder Society more.

Ozen: Hey. Maybe stay indoors and take the rest of the night easy.

She's a hard woman to read but the intent seems good. There are no deceptive motives behind her words.

Locke: I may have been invited to a conversation with the Demon of Duskar and I don't want to upset this man.

Ozen: What business does he have with you.

Locke: We met him at Brickshire and out of our group for some reason he likes me the best, and he saw me at Gizmos shop..

Ozen: And why would he take a liking to you...

Oscar: Ozen now don't you think we're being a bit too brazen.

Ozen: My apologies. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from that monster.

Samaroth: What is your hatred towards him?

Ozen: I was a general during the Daein war along with the Demon himself. I fought for my country. I fought because it was the right thing to do. He fought because it was fun.

Locke: You weren't at the battle of the burning keep were you?

Ozen: I was not.

Oscar: I was at the battle of the burning keep.

Locke: You don't think the Demon had anything to do with the eye slashing do ya?

Oscar: Seeing the two generals fight was like watching poetry in motion. Anything you have heard about the Demon of Duskar is watered down, but if there is anything that is true. He would never betray Ferrick. I could meet you guys at your rooms after you go meet Gregor (Demon of Duskar)

Oscar is going to stop by after Locke's meeting with Gregor.

Neil: My father is the first mate on the Pliothea do you know anything about that?

Ozen: that is above my pay grade but it is a big government job.

Neil: With all the info we have I think we have a unique position here because we haven't done enough jobs here for anyone in the spellbinder society to know that we are working for you. Now if we had a way of communicating with you from afar we could keep you up to date.

Ozen: How do you expect we keep this communication?

Neil: **points at stone phone**

Ozen: I cannot just give them away. They are a limited resource.

Ozen gets requested to an emergency meeting and we are left with Oscar. Medics then arrive and take the dwarves to the infirmary to get treated.

Oscar: Sorry about that is there anything I can do for you while I'm here?

Nick continues to try and pry a `Sending Stone` out of the Lawmaster's possession.

Locke leaves Ozen's office and make our way into the Zorin district and finds Chans Drinks. It's a smaller tavern and doesn't seem very lively. As he enters he sees Gregor in a back corner with his feet on the table sound asleep. In front of him is a massive pitcher of mead. Locke walks forward and wakes him up. Gregor references Locke as the son of Ferrick. Locke notices that he is in a very jolly mood which is not usual.

Gregor asks Locke: Why aren't you a soldier, like your father?

Locke: That life didn't speak to me and my father always talked of being betrayed and that didn't take kindly to me.

Gregor: I know what you must think in the back of my mind. That I had done it.

Locke: It's crossed my mind, but the more people I talk with the more I hear that Ferrick is the only man you ever cared about.

Gregor: He was my brother, I would never harm him. I am giving the opportunity - perhaps die with yours. **He gets up and stretches** It's finally here, the war god again smiles upon us.

*Panic begins in the street and the bells sound*

Gregor: I'm glad I found you I'm going to give you the chance to do what you were meant to do. Come with me come see your father. I've been given orders by the king, hear those bells. There is to be a war, a war with the Farlands. Best to be on the winning side of it.

# Episode 14: Fear of the Farlands

*DING* *DONG* *DING* *DONG* *DING* *DONG* we hear from the tavern.

Bit makes his way down to the bar to check out what is happening. The bartender tells us that the bells can mean a few things spanning from natural disasters to runaway criminals.

Locke hears some individuals spewing propaganda as he is walking back towards the tavern his party is staying at: The Immovable Mug.

We wake up from the night and Locke begins to spill some information about what happened with Gregor during his meeting. Apparently Gregor want's us all to come support him in the war with the Farlands. Locke's brother has 'sight-rot' and the Demon offered him the best healers. He reveals that his name is Creed Ironjaw son of Ferrick Ironjaw.

Neil takes out a loin cloth and unveils the iPod and tells Camilla that his mission is to save a dying world that he believes his mother has been taken to.

The party has a hard decision to make as we need to determine whether or not we go to the capital to participate in the war.
Bit want's nothing to do with the war as is his personality. All I really want to do is adventure and figure out some information and travel to dwarvish colonies.

#### Neil Locke and Camilla

They go to the mail house and Locke looks to send a letter. Neil spots a dog looking thing that makes eye contact with him between the legs of the visitors present.

Camilla looks to obtain her package from the mail house and isn't able to due to the lack of a last name.
The mailer is hesitant to give a package without valid understanding of who it is the package is going to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DECISION: There are sending labels on all mail related services.

Neil wants Camilla to talk to the mail lady, however Neil takes over and asks if there is any mail for Jarold Mack. Which there is no mail for that name. Neil also asks if it is under the business name 'The Pliothea' to which she says she cannot give those over to a child.

#### Bit

Goes to the Lawmaster's office to question what they may know about the recent bombings.

- Investigations are ongoing but given the green smoke, it's likely the same people.

Also going to question about the war that Locke talked about potentially happening with the Farlands.

It is no longer a rumor that is what Ozen is occupied with. Ozen had been taken by Imperia guards to be the general.

What triggered the war?

The embargo - refusing sale of oracalcum to the Farlands. That's what Ashnar is selling.

As your friend such circles are difficult to get into so I will tell you that Kragen Goldheart is not the place to begin learning of that embargo. Oscar says with a wink.

#### Camilla and Neil

Journey to 'The Fantastic Fletcher': They make arrows and stuff.

#### Locke

Doing a half shift at the tinkerer.

Gizmo needs some muscle to help out with the automaton work.
He has been trying to open the chassis for the better part of three hours.

>It was here Christian didn't know how the Dungeons and Dragons money system worked.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DECISION: How often does Camilla have to feed: 2 weeks

#### Neil and Bit

Decide to go to the menagerie to talk with Marcus Made, in order to locate Kragen Goldheart.

We look at the Job Posting Board finding:

Madame Booak: clear out an unwanted infestation within the Stonemarsh crypts.

#### Camilla

Bumps into a tiefling that was admiring Sebastion, that seems to be flirting with Camilla.
Biore is the tiefling's name. Camilla asks his reasoning, and he explains that he would like to have a date with her that night.
Sebastion explains that Camilla is already married. Biore is still trying to get Camilla to company him for the night.

#### Locke

Answers the door for a customer and meets with Oscar, who apparently knows Gizmo well - could be a relationship built from the past war.
Oscar brought a small cube shaped container which contains a crystal of unrefined oracalcum.

Gizmo takes it and very carefully - Oscar questions Locke's involvement with Gizmo. Gizmo says the oracalcum will do and returns to the counter to thank Oscar for what he was able to provide him.

#### Neil and Bit

As we approach it doesn't seem open,however it is staffed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DECISION: Guidance casting more efficient in party > 2

Staff members name was Ben Dover, a male furbolg, very tall.

After mentioning we were in the escort group we are ushered in to meet with Marcus.

We are led into a room with a scarred Marcus May on a bed surrounded by clerics.

> Daein decalred war on Farlands and emposed embargo

Kragen is not going to be in town much longer, he planned on heading north.

Kragen has a family estate in the city: Eldis district.

Story about the Farlands: Apparently Marcus has heard they have gone through a lot of wars. They had a big event happen a little before the veil dropped. Allegedly in some circles they claim they had a mortal ascend to a deity status truly not just in name. The religious groups have been denying that it happened but it is an interesting rumor.

> Potentially do some work for Marcus getting him some fey realm creatures.

He is also working on getting a teleportation circle set up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everyone has a HUD for location addresses

#### Camilla

Is being taken out to dinner by Biore. The restaurant is rather fancy, Sebastion almost got kicked out but he paid the waitress a gold to let him stay.

Camilla gives information about the ring and why Sebastion is bound to her. Biore takes interest and may help try and investigate the removal of such a ring.
He is an artificer (Might be linked to the spellbinder society?), he invites Camilla to his workshop to examine the ring.

His father was a tinkerer that gave him the curiosity, he makes contraptions.

As Camilla follows him outside the Eldis district, something feels wrong... (sex dungeon incoming)

Camilla gets taken down a dark alley... and gets frozen by a trap laid for her.

As this happens there is a growl behind her and Biore says 'You're easier to find than you think.'

His disguise drops and he is identified as

#### Locke

Locke sees Camilla leaving with some guy in the distance as he leaves Gizmo's shop.

As Camilla goes into the alley he spots a dog enter behind them.

#### Locke and Camilla

Locke sneaking behind goes to attack the dog that is flanking Camilla.

As he hits the dog it reforms with a jelly like force and starts to transform into something much more fierce.

-- Combat Begins --

Camilla -> Biore -> Locke -> Dog

Camilla says "Locke I don't think that's the dog, I think that's the Ice Dragon!"

I'm unsure who this guy is, but it's not looking good for them - he has legendary actions and is rather, strong.

Dravenguard end up coming and tell them to stay around for questioning soon.

#### Neil and Bit

Bit and Neil pray for a bit while they are fighting.

> [!NOTE]
> For praying we get a week bonus. Add a d4 to any saving throw we roll.

#### All at tavern

Camilla is being chased by some people that are broken. Once we get back to the castle we won't have to worry about it. None of us have any clue what castle.

Biore is a friend of Camilla's dead father. The Count is her husband who happens to be after her because she ran from the castle.

During Camilla's flashback The Count was talking to someone associated with the frost dragon. Biore had the ring of Stygia.

Morning comes and we are awoken to what sounds like chaos downstairs. We take a few steps down and Neil recognizes some of the crew of the Pliothea filtering into the Immovable Mug.

# Episode 15: Precious Cargo

11th of Tyra (Tagos)

We catch Samaroth up since he was sick with foot fungus yesterday.

As we head downstairs we notice there are a lot of new faces.
Neil notices many of these faces as the crewmen of the Pliothea.
Neil recognizes one of them a man with a generic dad physique, that is very happy to tell a story anytime.
He is one of the bosens on the ship. He knows this man as Rodrick Wilhelm.

Neil approaches Rodrick and gets ignored at first word. He then jumps onto the table to gain his attention.
He successfully does so as Rodrick screams Neil's name as a dark look comes over his face.
A few of the other crewmen get the same unfortunate look.

Rodrick asks what Neil is doing there, and why they began to look down. Neil introduces us and they seem rather impressed at Neil's flying companion.
Rodrick then asks to speak with Neil privately.

Rodrick tells Neil that his father didn't exactly come back with the rest of them.
He begins to explain to Neil that we are in some strange times with the tension with the world currently.
He talks about a government job they picked up with Imperia.
They wanted the most skilled ship and crew they could hire for some specific cargo. (name of the episode here)

Some of the Imperia people came with them and after leaving Shadow Spire Isles...
Look I don't even know what the cargo was. The Imperia soldiers handled all the guarding and transportation of the cargo.
We weren't sure why he agreed to the job.
On the way back we ran into some trouble, there were some unknown signals, or flares coming from an unnamed island.

We had never seen an island like this, it was large, you would think it would be on a map. A sound stared that drove the crew mad.
The Imperia mages were able to save some of us.
Those that they didn't help, like your father, began to jump ship and swim toward the island.
Something was pulling them under as they swam toward the island.
I did everything I could to try and get them to save those who jumped.
However, the Imperia soldiers took control of the ship when the captain went overboard.
They claimed that the package was far more valuable than those that went over.

The Island has strange red trees and tall brown grass.
It was off in the distance and it was night.
It looked like there was some structure, but we didn't get a great look at it.

> Everyone wakes up at 8am every morning.

Trip to the unmarked island is about an 8-day round trip.
Rodrick will help us if we help him.

#### Neil and Bit

Counter guy at the brothel: Mark Suckerfert's name is Mark

Neil tricks him with a fake ID, and he lets us past him.
We get led to the well guarded penthouse.

> Crayon IDs are canon

Bit and Everen talk about the events that happened while guarding Marcus May and Kragen Goldheart.
Everen (from the farlands) gives Bit some ***Liquid Cum*** a fine wine from his land.
They discussed the events and Everen wants to be kept in the loop.
He is very invested as he has made his living from the other side of the oracalcum exchange.
I should not mention his name around anyone loyal to Imperia as they are aware of who he is.

During this time Neil is playing with toys supplied by Everen's guards.

Find some things out for Everen, he will sponsor it.
This whole changeling thing isn't sitting right with him.
Something else is going on nearby that may be closely related, he would appreciate that I be a point of contact between him and Ozen.

He has spent a small fortune building himself up in the Farlands around oracalcum.

First thing he needs to know is: a few strange disappearances of some folk in the city. Last lights chapel is where we should go.
The owner Esmerelda has been acting strange. Reported to the law-master's office, get that report and see her.
Figure out her character and report back to him.

#### Locke

Goes to Gizmo's tinker shop

Gives Locke an exoskeleton for a firearm and asks him to mess around with it for the day.

#### Samaroth and Camilla

Go to the Zorin district

Camilla persuades Samaroth to try and talk to someone that she is trying to feed on.
Their current plan is to put the victim to sleep.
As the gagged man is bitten he is awoken. He fails to break through Camilla's grasp.
Camilla feels nutritonally sated for the next two weeks.

After the feeding Samaroth decided to stab him in the throat.
They then begin to disguise the body in order to delay the discovery of the murder scene.

#### Neil and Bit

Neil pickpockets 2 platinum from Bit.

We head over to Kragen's estate in the Eldis district.

We catch Kragen with a few servants loading up a carriage.

The embargo was a blindside to the Goldhearts. No rumors or warnings overnight our largest market completely removed.
The funny part is if Ashnard wants to start a war with the farlanders and ban the sale of everything.
He can thank the exchange for turning Daein into the country it is now and not the worst of the three kingdoms.

Farlanders have a strong military. Apparently a deity walks among them and fights with them.

Purified Oracalcum can be used to do minor things.
Raw Oracalcum can be used to enhance items, enchantments, power certain mechanisms. Extreme magical source, it is very unstable.

He's going home to Galescar and says there is always a door open for our company.

>[!NOTE]
    Attempt to go to Galescar, as a major dwarven city it would be a great place for Bit to go.

#### Locke

Is still at Gizmo's and tries to make progress on the firearm but fails to make any meaningful headway.

#### Camilla and Samaroth

They go to some fortune-teller, she goes on about some 'super important' future telling.
It's all super vague and easy to believe because it certainly could happen.

#### Everyone

We meet up at Gizmo's, afterward we all talk about our day.

Bit notices he is missing 2 platinum pieces from the 10.

Oscar makes it to the Immovable Mug and says that Ozen is back.
Her new duties are similar to her old duties however at a larger scale.

Oscar takes great concern with Neil's missing father.
Oscar is willing to help cut our trip in half.

Oscar dumps why he is called the Demon of Duskar

Duskar is a Crimean village that is directly to the west of the border.
In the final months of the wars, there was a politian in Daein Xavier Tutmose.
He was a very open critique of Ashnard and the brutality of Daein soldiers.
After Daein was clearly winning Xavier fled to Crimea.
Ashnard did not like this insult, so he sent Gregor Ironclad to retrieve Xavier.
Gregor crossed into Crimea and marched onto Duskar and when denied entry he slaughtered them all.
Men, women, children, it did not matter.
He had no idea what Xavier looked like so he killed everyone that moved.
He is pure evil. All of the stories point to him being pure evil.
He has gone out of his way to kill skilled warriors.
Almost started a conflict with Benyon by killing a notable mercenary from there.

# Episode 16: Through hell or high water

12th of Tyra, Fudos

#### Locke and co

They go to the mailhouse and there is nothing there for Locke.

#### We head down to the docks

As we approach the docks, Neil hears an odd humming noise.

When we catch eye of Oscar, we notice that he is dressed much differently.
Wrapped in normal adventuring gear comes to a shock as he is normally in formal clothing
He assures us that he has been on an adventure involving a boat before.

We all see Roderick and Derrick, preparing a middle sized ship named: The Misfits Gamble.
Neil is greeted by a large grin from Roderick, 'This looks like a full crew to me'.
Derrick is a large man, but doesn't give off very intelligent vibes.

Ship roles

Captain: +1 Con +1 Persuasion & Deception, controls 2 npcs
First Mate: Can fill any position, +5 so social Charisma checks
Bosin(Roderick): Make repairs to ship, 1 d20 for each proficiency level, +2 strength

Powder monkies (2 spots): adv on cannon attacks, melee +1 to hit
Quartermaster(Derrick): Steers ship, +3 to survival
Cook: Does not need to use camping supplies for long rest, +1 to dexterity
Surgeon: Healing ally, gets full amount of healing

We begin to sail off into the Alabaster sea.

Apparently Neil has something on his head.

A small ship comes sailing by, and we board it.
While this happens Bit is fully focused on his potato stew.

Locke, Neil, and Samaroth board the ship and go below deck to a humanoid corpse.

They come across some writing in the ship: 'Trees of red, hide your dead'

![Lore Reveal]: Neil tells us that the paint on his face covers a birthmark

Neil's Mother:

- Came from an underground mountain city Lendrath
- Was an adventurer
- Worked for Rainwallow as a healer
- Not sure if she was associated with the conflict
- She may have been in a guild

Why do Oscar's eyes glow green:

- Unsure really

We are gathered at night for a meeting when Bit is asked a bit about the village he grew up in called Cache. Oscar seems to not believe the story Bit gives.

> Oscar has level 3 royalties with Kruger Kreel.

Neil tried to use Oscar's rewards and fails miserably.

>[!NOTE]
    Oscar can give up to 50% discount on a single item

#### Bit has a dream

- A lot of personal things happen, in solonotes

### Next Day, A Tsunami is coming at the boat

We narrowly evade the wave using Oscars wind magic and make it safely to the other side.

### A Skeleton boat is on the other side of the wave

The Skeletons board our ship and combat begins.

Initiative:

1. Neil
2. Bit
3. Samaroth
4. Oscar
5. Locke
6. Melee Enemies
7. Ranged Enemies
8. Derrick

10. Camilla

# Episode 17: Lost and found

Samaroth and Locke obtain a chest containing 3012 gold 1012 silver 308 bronze = 3116 gold 2 silver 8 bronze

>[!IMPORTANT]
    Each player gains 446 gold, since we had to share with the two npc

Derrick name change to Broderick changes take place

>[!NOTE]
    Ship sinking takes 20 minutes on average

Locke knows about the significance of trees with red branches.
He remembers red trees being symbols being associated with the astral sea.

14th of Tyra

Right when the sun rises we hear a bell, alarming us that we have arrived at our desination.

The island we approach has a beach shore with a plethora of large red trees inland.

We all place makeshift earplugs in as we approach, because of what happened to the previous pursuers.

We begin to venture into the forest and Oscar speaks to Samaroth.
He mentions that the boy doesn't have protection.
He seems rather invested in Neil's safety.

We run across some buildings as we approach a clearing.

We approach a villager and he is rather surprised to see us.
He mentions that there have been some people here recently.
Neil describes his father, and they seem to know who he's talking about.
He is a bit, old and forgetting, a younger female comes around to help him out.
She's mid.

Samaroth breaks his cover by kicking a stick that rolls a rock into someone's fence.

Heavily female to male ratio here for whatever reason... sirens maybe?

Podereick is a member of the Pliothea. Captain Helios.
Some of the members of the ship have horrible injuries and bandages.
A communal gasp happens once we appear. A hammerhead shark humanoid with a large rifle is before us.
He looks at Neil and is silent. The humaniod begins to smile and extend his arms as he shouts 'NEILLL what are you doing here'

Neil's father seems to be alive, he's in the restroom.
Apparently Neil's mother (Stella) told Neil's father that Neil was coming to save him.

Neil's father (Gerald), attempts to shake Locke's hand. And he trips and spills some water on him.

The woman that escorted us brings Broderick and Roderick as we are discussing Gerald's false memories.

Oscar seems to think that this situation is familiar in a bad way, he can't seem to figure out.

I probe into Gerald's mind, and we see the storm that took out the Pliothea. The ship seems to be going under. Another vision takes place. Gerald is talking to a woman, a gnome in armor Stella,. neils mother.

I ask Gerald (telepathically) if that was Neil's mother, and how long it has been since she was here. He answers that it was a while ago and doesn't know an exact time.

Camilla escapes her pursuer

Roderick and Broderick lost the ship... They respond with 'where else would we be going'

Broderick did not plug his ears and drove the ship into shallow waters and broke the ship.
Locke suggests fixing the ship, and Roderick says this is beyond us. Gerald is reluctant to come with us.

Captain Helios' eyes begin to enlarge and wisp with a white hue.
Neil attempts to cast `lesser restoration` on him to no success.

Locke begins to question Helios about the details before the ship went down.

As we walk to the boat, Neil stabs one of the members. He then heals the memeber to confirm if he was undead or not.

Karaxus, we have to go.
Oscar (Karaxus?) says, go where? They don't know you idiot.

The man that approached us begins to smoke green and appear as a changeling before us. Neil then walks forward says 'imposter' and throws a `guiding bolt` at him for 40 damage.

The ship is fucked and it's very unlikely we fix it.

We try and convince Oscar, that we are cool with him. He casts `dimention door` away from us.

Neil casts `Identify` on the island itself. He learns that the effect is cast on a creature.

Samaroth has large feet.

Locke begins to drown the changeling.

The island makes an affliciton on those that are impacted. The noise they hear.
Changeling ears are immune to this. Neil doesn't seem to have long.
The 'nervous systems' are collecting people for some purpose.
They collect a few people every once in a while and bring them somewhere unknown.

The changeling may have a way to get us out, if we help him.
The captain saw a ship from the skies earlier that crashed overhead.
The ship was a welcome surprise, farlanders from his understanding.
We might be able to salvage this air vessel.
Whatever was on the vessel, it was important. The farlanders are looking for it.
The village raided the ship and assumingly have whatever it is that was on the ship.

The changeling thinks someone will be held where they keep their valuables. He wants us to rescue this guy.
