# Personal Notes

- Why does Neil's magic rewind time, what could that have to do with the savior of the past births the child of the future?
- I want to know what happened to Oscar, thats why I am attempting to attune to the fey realm
- There has to be more as to why Ky'mytha wants Camilla's ring so bad
- What to do in Dravenhold?

## Counts

LooksToBeCount = 144

Camilla needs to feed on the 22nd of Manaros.

## Old Notes

I have become a rather good cook during my time sailing.
Potato soup has become one of my prized dishes.

> We can go on the boat 8 day round trip
> We are probably going to Dravenhold (Daein capital)
> Galescar is also on my list of things to do
> Raid the city, get the goods, try and get farlanders to rescue us.
> Oscar could be the guy running the inside job, and wants to keep close tabs on Neil and 'lead' us in the right direction.
> Ozen could very well be a changeling, the changelings could be far deeper than we know.
