### Learning: Fey Magic

Recreate what Oscar taught me.

``` md
The space between awake and asleep, the inbetween

Ability to pass between realms is through the inbetween.
If you can feel this place you can pull on the fey realm for power.

For a moment I cannot feel my body. Similar to when I was visited by the fateweaver. I hear 'youre already there' in an echoed state. 'All you need to do is reach out and take it'. Another voice joins and says 'take it.' in a voice that is not the fateweavers.

I return to wake, and oscar is in his changeling state. He returns to human state very tired.
```

1. Feel the space between being awake and asleep
2. Feel for the inbetween and I can pull fey power
3. If I get to the point where I can't feel my body I have succeeded
4. Reach out and take the power
