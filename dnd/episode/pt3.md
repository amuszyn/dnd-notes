# Part 3

## Episode 30: Duality

We arrived at the church of Destin, a couple of days outside the capital city.
Strange creature known as Emissary:
the monster that touched Neil and went into his brain.
We obtained Cedric Tilly, the hairy frog.

Locke does his communion while we are reading folk lore in the library.

We are seeking the restricted section from the High Priestess
Some information about the intersection about Theos and Destin

Apparently the information is held in the 'fate valut' and isn't accessable to us.
It was described that this specific tome is very dangerous in the wrong hands.

Locke beins to explain his vision, lots of sand it formed into an hourglass.
Most of the sand was at the top, which makes him feel like hes not going to die.

We make our way to the inn because sebastion smells something rather odd in the garden

Neil wants to steal from the vault despite us saying not to.
Locke wants to flip a coin for it.

We get a room, numbered 18

I go into the fey realm and successfully find the space between awake and asleep.
I find myself being guided through the realm.
I fail to pass through but on my way out
I smell something, that I recognize as Samaroth's feet

Talking with Camilla after the journey I mention the smell
Samaroth's feet are what Sebastion smelled at the gardens

The vessil of samaroth has shown up at our door.
He had to be invited in the room
He claims to be the being that Samaroth made a pact with.
The demon Ky'Mytha

Part of the contract was that should he ever fall, the body becomes his.
When Samaroth was under the services he was given a mission;
Camilla apparently has something he needs. The ring of purgatory.

The demon was the one who pulled me deeper in the fey realm.
The demon also doesn't know how to remove the ring, but wants it after it is removed.
He also has information about the individual after Camilla.

Ky'Mytha claims to be of opposition of the fateweaver.
The intruder making his way into his realm, with his dreamers.

He knows where the ring can be removed, places beyond the material plane of course.
A place with a vast sort of... tinkerers.
If we are to take things further he needs a binding contract.
Tries to spin up a contract with all of us.

Lore about the ring:
When the universe was created the gods used the hells to seal away primordial beings.
Sealing them away into the Abyss,
there are 9 locked away into each realm of the hells
The Avernus used to be prison to a primal titan known as Ricta Zole,
slain by the gods before time began to flow.
In order to seal them away even the gods needed a conduit, or focus.
There was one made for each realm in the hells, and whoever controlled all the rings,
ruled over the hells, the rings were given to the god Bellacore,
who ruled over the hells for as long as time had flown.
This was until the veil was created, such a rift was so powerful it separated,
some of the material plane, the hells, the fey wild,
and the shadow realm to name a few.
When the veil dropped chaos ensued, and now that Bellacore has come back,
he intends to collect what is his.
Bellacore has made strange powerful friends and not a fight he wishes to be in.

The inbetween is his place, now Bellacore.
To travel between the hell realms you must pass through the inbetween.
Jumping between the fey and the material plane,
from jumping from fey to hell is hard.
The fey is one adjacent to the material plane.

Any time you teleport you momentarily pass through the inbetween.

Camilla insight checks Ky'Mytha successfully:
She knows a desperate move when she sees one.

Contract:
Once the ring is removed from Camilla it becomes Ky'Mytha's property.
We are responsible for the shipping. He will help.
Only way to break it is if we find a way to remove the ring and want to keep it.
We have a week after the ring leaves Camilla's finger.

Knowledge items:
The one hunting Camilla has been busy and fixed on Camilla.

Neil asks him where Oscar is, his exact location with proof.
Twisted Forest, which is where the fateweaver resides.

Right now Bellakor lays conquest onto the pandamonium, it will eventually be over.

Camilla, Locke, and Bit all sign the contract rather quickly.
He says that there shouldn't be any issue with the contract I currently hold.

Neil requests a round trip ticket to wherever his mother is when we give the ring.

> Bit now gets bonuses to his rolls when attempting to traverse the inbetween

The individual is the one that is currently tracking Camilla.
The individual approached him under the name Varys, still thinking he was Samaroth.
He claims to have been making friends lately.
He said that he has made a few friends from the north.
Ky'Mytha believes that he has made an accordance with Camilla's home.
He travels in a form that is unknown to Ky'Mytha, it is not teleportation,
but he is gone in the blink of an eye.

Camilla's ring might have much more power than percieved.

The Inbetween is a timeless place. There is no Map, its just a void.

He seems to know about the text relating to the When Death Marches.
He's placing the text around 1600 years in the past, it is bound in flesh.
The demon is unsure how to read the text - he is sure it is hidden somehow.

We can attempt to let Bit traverse himself through the Inbetween.

Ky'Mytha knows about the Spellbinder Society.
Mentions they are a newer organization (he is 36_000 years old).

Ky'Mytha says that there is no damage to Bit's brain.

Bit succeeds to traverse the Inbetween to obtain the text from the fate vault.

> First roll needed was 14, second was 18.
> Ky'Mytha gives a +5 and +3 for Arcana

## Episode 31: The Vault

I am pulled into somewhere dark for a moment, my senses falter.
I see the large hunched sickly green visige horned, with a large underbite.

> Rolled a 16 to get to the library vault

I am thrown through a portal, to a large metallic door.

> Torches are held by golden sticky tack

I hear movement, from either side of the doors.
Whichever one I take I enter the same room.
Sounds like mechanical guards.

I see a large set of heavy armor that seems to move on its own.
In the cracks I see etherial yellow hue.
Bound together by golden strings to form a humanoid form.
Back of the head is completely bald.
I cannot see its face,
but something is clearly coming out from the front of the head.

I approach a pedistal with a glass covering,
There is a well encrested compass on top of a pillow,
No NSEW, just the compass needle.
It slowly spins clockwise, comes to a hault and spin the opposite direction.
Etched into the sign, 'fate finders compass'

Hanging on the wall, I see a single bronze key.
Scribed is 'key of the timeless path'

The main big book is called 'the ever changing'

We see a portal, and through it we see a scene
A fairground, some guards there, many innocent people are shown
Then suddenly a high pitch ringing noise grows louder and louder
We can feel something arcane about it
The people in the streets begin to go mad with agression, feral

'You have the power to save all these people at the expense of anothers fate'

A simialr portal opens
A small child in Valeria, a child
This boy is destened to save his kingdom and thousands of lives
unfortunately he was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

'Would you save the life of the one lord destined to save his people,
or those impacted by a disaster that has already been'

They chose the boy and he did not respond in a hostile nature.

Now he wants a sacrifice.
To gain something you must lose something.
Offer something to Destin, something of value.

Things in the vault:

- Fatefinders compass
- Destin's eternal flame
- Key of the Timeless Path
- Fate Father's Ring
- The Ever Changing - Tome
- The Codex of Forgotten Destinies - Tome
- The Scroll of Banished Tomorrows - Tome

The Ever Changing:

The Chrono Vault, only those who know how to walk between moments can find it.
Risk unraveling the threads of reality.

## Episode 32: Half a stack

Right into combat, because Locke tried to steal a book

Warden -> Locke -> Bit -> Neil -> Camilla

Bit tries to steal, bit needs to get out of this somehow.

## Episode 33: Bitter Reunion

Fought the warden of the vault. Beat the warden.
Then we started looting everything in your path.
We = Bit

I then went invisible, sealing us all in the vault.

Bit returns the ring, deshrouds in front of the priestess and gets bound in the process.

As we exit, we see eight more guards outside.
This is odd because we don't know where they came from.
There were not this many people here before.
We are awkwardly escorted outside the walls of the church.

We are banned from the church because of Bit.

We have a horse and a mule and a wagon.

We travel and come across a very small town.
> Restrained -> cannot use Material or Somatic related things, hands are bound
> Tenticles give flanking

Neil wants to stop at a tiny mart to find stamps.
> Stamps are used in this world

As Neil is trying to grab a nic nack from this shop.
A character comes up behind him, a dwarf.
Locke sees him come behind Neil, and he says to Neil 'you almost fucking done kid'

Neil is given a fidget spinner.
Garen Joel is the dwarf that they meet.
He knows Locke's name is Creed.

He is with the Bitterbrew Accord.
Many of them scattered around the country.
They're all coming after us, and they're all looking for Locke.
He keeps talking about this Shane fellow.
Apparently he ran into someone named Blake.

Just two days ago Shane and Garen are making a supply run.
They came into contact with a Red Balance. They got Shane.

Garen has no clue why they want Locke so bad.
Locke doesn't give him anything, suggests his father maybe.

Red Balance are legal adjacent to the Dravenguard.
Dravenguard are paid off to look the other way.

To overthrow the Bitterbrew Accord they made some friends.
Blake knows more about the contact.
Blake should be set up somewhere in the woods.
They're looking for him because he's one of the last Brewmasters left.

Where was Garen 'that night', he responds with 'Living'

Locke accuses Garen of knowing they were going to be invaded.
Garen claims to be very loyal to his group.

How important is Shane, wouldn't be surprised if he's already dead.
We're going to go look for Blake.

> Oxford University exists in Benyon

We finally see in the distance large stone walls.
The city walls themselves are about 60 feet thick
It's a very busy place, lots are going on. We are in the common area.
Most buildings are made of stone, not much made of wood.
Looks like Minas Tirith. There are 4 tiers of the city.
We make our way to T2 of the city.
As we travel there is a building that looks akin to Krugers Charms and Arms.
Locke knows it is a magical shop. Quite a popular place, not the only one.
There is another one in T3. They don't just let anyone in to T3.
Status gets higher as you go up.

Large bazzar, exotic jewlery store, exotic clothing store.
Restaurant that has foreign cuisne.
Pop-up stand of different zodiac nic nacs.

There is a Blacksmith hub. Raised with stone pillars.
Tons of Dravenguard are around, the Blacksmith are making weaponry.
Normally there is a head of the Dravenguard as they patrol.
The group we see has a mixture of spellcasters, archers and others.
We notice a section only inhabited by golbin kin.
As we move through we see a mercinary/adventurers guild.

> JFK was killed by Red Balance, Jerimiah Frode Khan

Once we enter the T2 district, it is far less congested.
Still plenty of people but far less than the T1.

> Stable fee is 5 silver a night

Binx Brew, is something we want to ask for.
The Tavern's Name: The Gilded Gutter
A Ganesh looking dude is the bartender.

> Tavern is 6g night

Neil orders some milk with honey.
The bartender grabs the milk out of a bag of colding.
We order the Binx Brew and the bartender seems a bit surprised.
We find a table and stay a while.

## Episode 34: What Draven Holds

War is on the horizon and the king wants Locke(Creed)'s dad to participate

An elven woman escorts us behind the counter.
We hear very heavy breating, and the large elephant man is standing.
He has blood caked on his knuckles, we see two orcs beaten unconcious.
Orcish woman is loading the unconcious ones to take them away.
The back is much larger than the area we were just in.
In the middle there is a chalked out fighting pit.
We see a large bar, and many people placing bets on the fights to come.
We await to see the Gorefest v. Lobotomiser

We talk to a random person in the crowd, trying to figure out who to bet on.
He seems to know that the Lobotomiser
is 2x the size of the last guy he just fought so we bet on him.

Neil begins talking with Velen to join the fight ring.
Neil thinks he can take Thunderpunch.

Locke sees his brother, he runs and falls in front of Locke.
Locke claims to have been on vacation.

Neil is trying to give away 1k gold to bet on himself.
This Thunderpunch is gonna kill him.
Lobotomiser is a huge dude.
Gorefest looks like a tiny lean dude that's already fucked up.
His fists look hard and strong.
Lobotomiser wins - Valen yells ENOUGH as Lobotomiser takes it a little far.

Valen reveals a Farlander Platinum piece worth 1k gold.

Apprently Locke knows that Sayless is the bar maid.

> Camilla is racist

Sayless is a changeling, Locke and her go back to when he fought at the bar.

Red Balance has had whispers of a 'Rat Jaw' being mentioned.
All rumors of course.

Bit successfully teleports to the foreign cuisine place, kindof.
He ended up in the allyway near it, then walked back to the tavern.

We enter `Arcane Trinket and Dodads`
Finnick Whisp

We enter `The Molten Anvil`

## Episode 35: Last Stop

> First Joe Episode

Locke had a reunion with his father and his little brother Flint.

Nox: 6'3 270, long white hair human, decent sized white beard. Icy blue eyes. Leather armor, tunic with some axes.

Neil notices a partially hidden tattoo, he recognizes this symbol as the Red Balance.

We discuss a proposition with Nox and he seems to have left the Red Balance.
He has a wife and his son was stolen from him by the Balance.
Locke has a contact that says the Red Balance has some stuff in the north.

We make our way to Locke's house to eat dinner with his family.
He doesn't believe his father has any association
with Galescar or The Oracalcum Exchange.

Father Ironjaw is a large orc with a cloth tied around his eyes.

> [!info] Talking With Ironjaw
> Does he know anything about magical organizations?
> Does he know anything regarding the Oracalcum Exchange?
> Do you know anything about Galescar?

Nox see's one of the blue crows.

Triss Goldheart, joined the family business.
She's somewhere in the city.

Tenth of Menaros - the ball episode, lots of influential people will be there.

King is having a formal event to celebrate his return.
It's there so he can make a proper declaration of war.
Apparently he has an important announcement.

Upper tier entry is only permitted to those that are recognized by the guards.
You have to know the right people.
As he is talking there is a lound knock at the door..

Duskar walks into the dinner party.

Locke's dad is not a fan of Duskar at all.

'You know this brings me no pleasure, but he's your king too'

Whatever it is Ferrick won't do it.

Neil blows his whole load on the kid's face.
(He casts healing spells on Flint's face)

Sebastion has been serving Camilla for 165 years 3 months 5 days
Camilla has been alive less than 350 years.

Nox knows where they would take to interrogate people (wonder why)
There is no single prison, there are locations based on security level.
The more secured the closer to the center of the city.

We take the night to sleep at the tavern, Noxx stays up to work and close the tavern.

The cold man, comes in looking like a full blooded orc. He freezes Matilda.

He embodies cold, Bit walks downstairs unnoticed and turns around to wake everyone.
Noxx levitates him and hits him with a barstool like a baseball bat
attempting to knock him out of the bar.

There is a small explosion and ice comes below the door.
We go outside to see the familiar body of Hagus (the regular).
There is ice everywhere around the bar.

Hagus was transmuted, I've only seen this a few times.
His bones are poped and shifted in ways that were not ment to be.

Guards show up to investigate the commotion.

Craig the Dravenguard is reporting this incident to Duskar.

The guards who interviewed us are named Steve, Buschemi

> [!note] Ending thoughts
> As the session comes to an end we decide to talk with Locke's contact Blake.
> We also will look to do some recon of the northern camp
> that is if Blake doesn't know anything about it.

## Episode 36: On The Trail

Two arcane groups are present in Dravenhold:
The Mages Guild, The Arcanum

> Question, which mage based society is afiliated with the govt

Noxx was an interrogator (torturer) for the Red Balance.

The librarian Janet - short deep gnome.

Bit is lead to the arcane section by a construct made of old book pieces.

Bit goes looking for mage society books, preferably about Benyon.

We find a book dated a few years ago.
I flip through and find the familar name from Benyon.

Two full pages about the spellbinder society.

The Spellbinder Society is regarded as a newer organization, founded around 120-130 years ago.
Annotation reads; exact dates and data may vary.
Another piece says there are multiple higher up orgs,
like the Oracalcum Exchange that have been in business,
however none say anything about meeting the memebers \
of the spellbinder society.

The leader of the Spellbinder Society, Eldric Moonbrooke,
has been the leader for the duration of the organization.
The founder who was unknown, for a year, passed it on to him.
No one knows if the founder is a part of it.

In recent events, rumor has it they are looking,
to expand their influence across oceans.

During this time Locke and Niel go off to talk to Blake.

Locke discusses the imporance of the event that his father is having him go to.

They meet up with Garen. Locke is disguised as Gizmo.

Locke follows Garen through the bushes, he seems to be following some markings.
Neil doesn't trust that he knows the way, however Garen seems confident.
Garen begins lifting up moss off the ground.
Locke and Niel are unsure what he is even looking for.
A crossbow bolt comes flying and lands between Garen's fingers.
A chuckle follows calling Garen skiddish.
A man in his 40s pops out and looks disgustingly good for his age.
Similar to Tom Brady, however this is Blake Blackfoot.

He is wearing thief guild garb,
that is of the highest quality and very fitted to his figure.
Blake was unaware of Garen bringing guests.

Neil complements his crossbow, that he got off a dead man apparently.
Neil then shows him the slingshot that he is proud of.
Garen reveals a really old wooden hatch under a loose piece of moss.
As they climb down it goes from being dirt to worked stone.

At the bottom there is a 8x8 meter room with a mattress.
It looks like someone has been held up here.
Presumably Blake and Garen.
Blake removes his gloves as he sits down revealing his blood stained hands.

Blake questions why Locke has come at this time, despite all that has happened.
Locke claims it is to get info to save Shane Flynn.
Blake thinks they killed him, they were trying to kill Garen as well.
Blake just so happens to be looking for some people to carry out a contract for the accord.

Apparently Blake has some info on Locke's father.
This is what he is holding over him to get him to do the contract.
He wants him to retrieve an item for him.
The Ebon Echo; it's a gemstone, or crystal, hard to miss.
They likely have it in some sort of container.
He doesn't spill too much about what it does.
Blake claims it would be better in the brew's hands then the balance.
The encampment to the North is a rumor, the only place Blake knows is in the city.
Blake has no clue where Shane is.

Blake plays some thought games, wondering why would the balance go norht?
The only reason blake can think of to go North is to hide something scary.
Blake seems like a rather manipulative man.
Neil draws a map leading to the hidden encampment of Blake during his time there.

Noxx, Bit, and Camilla met by Doug's Churro stand.
Doug is a MASSIVE man with a chefs hat and apron that says 'kiss the doug'.

> The curros are 3ft long.

We start heading to the Mage guild. Noxx wife frequents magical places of interest.
As we walk into the guild, Noxx see's the visage of Quill walking out.
Tyvon Marrick is Quill's actual name.
He is the spy master information broker guy for the Red Balance.
He is a pale gray color elf, who is super gaunt (thin). Looks malnourished.

A Tabaxi in purple robes comes up. Vaylen Solara.
Maser Rogar (Rogar) Thull - drow elf

As I approach he is chewing some newer member out.
'How many times have you done this same thing over and over'
Apparently the youngin wasn't doing a great job.
I need to pass an entry trial to join.
He pulls out a ledger, with multiple sticky notes on each page.

My trial is at 4 am, alone 3 days from now, the 11th of Monaros.

I attempt to link to him and notice it is blocked.
A ring on his finger makes a notable glare as I try.
Rogar is an archmage.

While we talk to the archmage, Noxx is waiting outside looking for the spymaster.
As Tyvon walks out, Noxx stops him looking to talk with him.
Noxx instantly asks about his son. Tyvon says that isn't his department.
Tyvon insures that Noxx knows where to go if he wants answers.
Noxx claims that they are not willing to talk with him.
Tyvon refers to him as 'Ratjaw's' mutt.

As we leave the mage's guild we meet up with Noxx, Neil, and Locke.

> Pedofiles head's explode.
> Neil could seduce people to death.

As we regroup, Locke says that Blake wants some gemstone.

Noxx left Dorn Ratjaw Eskel, the lead interrogator.
Took him off the streets, raised him and Noxx was the right hand man.
Ratjaw promised him that when he had a kid he could leave the guild no worries.
This wasn't the case and when he left they took his son.

We as a group are looking to figure out how to get more info.
The Red Balance seems to be the place to infliltrate.
Noxx could go back and not be in danger.
We could also have some others join the guild.

There are some clients that go directly to The Scale. The leader of the Red Balance.
We don't know his real name, he is only ever referred to as The Scale.
The higest rank Noxx has met is The Red Hand.

Whenever things are needed, Goldfingers is the one to contact.
Valen Dask (fight-pit leader) would also be a contact.

Noxx knows the recruiter Sarah Mourn.

We use the stone phone earpiece to contact Ozen.

Bit -> Are you coming to the ball, if so can we meet before?
Ozen -> The teleportation circle is almost finished, I will be there for the night of the ball and no longer.

Ozen -> I'm looking for a security detail. In Oscars absense.
Bit -> Certainly interested, we will be held up at the Last Stop.

Noxx tries to set up Doug to fake a robbery of Neil.
His only stipulation is that somone cover his stand.
Everyone stairs at Camilla.

I walk into the Red Balance guild hall.
Multiple round tables, haggered members with tattoos.
Some are visually branded, there is a bar here.
A couple of heads turn then go back to their business.

I walk up to the welcome desk.
We make rather gay sexual inuendos regarding swords and wood.
I go to sit at the bar. Many eyes flash my way when I do so.
The welcome desk guy did warn me that the memebers can be a bit abrasive.

Noxx enters as Bit goes down the stairs to the bar.
He goes upstairs to meet with Sarah Mourn's office.

Neil has an extravagant plan to try and get into the balance.
He goes down to the bar because there was no one there to receive him.

Locke and Camilla are doing some recon outside while this is all happening.
Locke is looking for some accessable windows.
Which they have on all four faces of the structure.

Camilla tries to climb up to the second floor using invisibility to conceal herself.

> Pedofile explosion, does fireball damage in 30ft radius.

Camilla fails to climb up and falls down. (natural 1 athletics check)

Looks like a half human golaith bartender woman.
I tell her to surprise me with a drink.
She grabs a mostly clear drink that looks like water which cost 3g pieces.

Neil approaches the bar. Most look and scoff.

Bit banters a bit with Neil as he holds the act of not knowing who Bit is.

Noxx makes it upstairs unbothered. He knows of the rooms that are present there.
There are 12 or so rooms there as well as the personal chambers of Sarah.
There is a guard talking to Sarah as he approaches her chambers.
The guard was the welcom center guy that talked with Bit, name unknown at this time.
Sarah invites Noxx in as the welcome center guy leaves.
Inside Sarah's room there is a long desk with many ledgers and documents.
Noxx questions Sarah about his son. Offers to join back in place of his son's freedom.

Sarah talks about this recruiting being a front.
She claims to not have the time to deal with the front and work in the shadows.
She seems to not have any knowing of them taking his son.
Noxx repeats his offer of rejoining for his son's freedom.
Sarah ensures that might not be possible.
Apparently the Red Balance doesn't want Noxx back.
Ratjaw is very upset and would harm Noxx in an instant if he were present.

Noxx fails to convince Sarah to help him with his son.
On his way out he says that his offer still stands.
While he walks out Sarah mentions quickly, he's out of town tonight as she shuts the door.

Camilla is picking a lock, as it clicks and the trap door opens, there is a rope connected and something snaps off.
A small burst of red light appears like a blown fuse.
Like an alerted trap.

> [!info] Last things ep 36
> Left off with Noxx leaving Sarah's room
> Bit and Neil are at the bar
> Bit is awaiting the welcome center guy, expecting to be talked to.
> Not sure what Neil is hoping for.
> Locke and Camilla are doing fuck all outside.

## Episode 37: Those filthy brown fingers

The bartender's name is Regina.

I tip the bartender 1 silver as I leave to follow the help desk guy.

They don't have any openings, I talk a little bit to the guy who says the reason isn't due to lack of work.
The reason he thinks is due to some organizational changes at the higher levels.

Bit and Noxx walk over to the alleyway where Locke and Camilla.
Locke re-opens the trap door, stealthily.
The floor is wooden, and the walls are green.

> The Dewey-decimal system is a cannon organizational system.

The walls are lined with filing cabinets in the dewey-decimal system.
There is purple colored ash on the documentes.
Locke casts detect magic and finds out that the filing cabinets are resinating with magic.

We all go down into the room, Bit and Locke get to investigating.
On the wooden shelf we find scripture written in elvish.
Likely due to the enchantment process. We feel the dust and it's akin to sandpaper.
There is a book with blank pages, the book is tearable which is meant for removing the pages.
Locke does midevil forensics and runs a pencil over it but finds no past writing.
There are no doors that we could find.

Bit notices that the shelves are enchanted, I am able to determine that there is some pairing that needs to happen.

We give up and exit the cellar.
Bit is disguised as the red balance help desk guy.

Neil is approached by a stocky man with small tusks despite having simiar features to a human.
He seems to have no intentions except interact with Neil.

Neil tells him that he was robbed, and had his wallet and dog stolen.
He questions Neil's being at the red balance, with how young he is.
The man wants Neil for a job, due to his small stature.
The man points over the hearth, larger figures with the human flesh and small tusks.
He invites Neil to have a seat with them to talk about the plan.
The man's introduces one of his companions and his name is Gremis.
The other companions are Grimice, and Gromice.
The last one's name is Gordon, he is the one that came over to talk to Neil at the bar.
Gremis seems to be the leader by vibes.
He gets to questioning Neil's story and he reiterates to the man.
Gremis invites Neil to a more private place to discuss the plan.
He want's Neil to steal something for them that is key to the plan.
Neil will get paid a fifth of the payment coming out to be 600 - 700 gold pieces.
Neil asks to be inaugriated into the guild as well, however Gremis says sternly that this is not guild work.
Gremis says he will consider it based on his performance during this job.

Neil cast's sending to Bit:
I might have an in, take care of Kei and stuff.

Locke and Noxx try and piggy back their way up to the second floor of the building.
Locke jams his finger and curses a little louder than intended.
He does recover due to his athleticism, by grabbing onto another gutter.
This one does not give in like the other luckily.
He checks for traps lining the window on the second story.
He sees some sort of suction mechanism that could alarm if he were to open the window.
Locke attempts to disarm the trap, he fails and his tools are jammed.
Inside the room, Locke see's the outline of a humaniod figure.

Camilla infiltrates while invisible. We await and play foosball during our downtime.

The plan is for Locke and Bit to go in.
Bit disguised as the help desk guy Locke being invisible.
Noxx will look to distract the front desk guy so we don't have a double situation.
Noxx will also have Sebastion during this time.

Noxx fails to remove the guy from the front counter.
He ends up at the bar downstairs, Neil is leaving the bar area.

Locke ends up in the closet with Camilla, and references 7 minutes in heaven.

Bit walks in disguised as Clyde, the desk man knows him.
Clyde is a greatly respected person, however he is not high up in the chain of command.

> Clyde is the Red Balance member the group killed with the help of Emissary.

Cole is the name of the desk man.

The new Tabaxi barman's name is Ridoc.
Apparently Ridoc loves fucking with Cole.

We get the door in the closet open.
It reveals a 9ft staircase leading underground.
Noxx has some information about it.
Interrogation chamber was first door to the left.

Bit goes and retrieves Noxx, Cole gets farmed and probably fears Clyde even more.

> Clyde's job was more of a jack of all trades.
> He then went into primarily bounty work.

Locke finds a storage room with three different sacks filled with dust?
Three colors, dijon mustard, metallic, and orange dust.
He puts them in three separate vials.

We enter the torture chamber, we see a chained figure, and empty shackles with fresh blood.
In the corner is someone flicking a key.

Flynn has orange hair, lengthly dude normally.
Looks a bit like Shaggy from Scooby Doo.
Has a baby face.

## Episode 38: What lies in the basement

> The 5 second rule: For 5 seconds after a creature dies they are not considered an object.

The episode starts with combat, inside the room we picked is a large person.

As we wipe everyone out, Camilla misses a lot of hits on a retreating enemy.
He makes it to the main floor and alerts the whole red balance.

We prep to fight the balance as they are coming into the basement.

Bit looks through the stash, finds the Ebon's Echo.
A black crystal that looks enchanted.
It's contained in a bottle and seems to defy gravity.

I find some excellent boots sitting in the corner of one of the closet.
I now have `fancy boots`

We exit the red balance and are instantly met with Dravenguard pointing weapons at us.

We are being detained by the Demon of Duskar and his guards.

Camilla being invisible she gets away and meets up with Neil at the bar.

We get escorted to a prison and are all three held in a cell.
Bit talks to Cole for a bit during the walk to the prison.
Maybe he made a little bit of an alliance who knows.
Cole does know that Bit was one of the people in the basement.
Whether or not that will matter is unknown.
I connect to a guard who put us in our cell.
He claims to be the
Foosball Champion, who thinks Bit is a deity.
Tells him that he is dealing with their case.
Bit talks to him about his problems, and he tells him that he known as the Traveler of Benyon.
The foosball champion says hes under a great deal of stress with what happened at the red balance hq.

Bit also casts `sending` to contact Locke's father and tells him that we are in prison, asking for his assistance.

> I need to talk to him and be like wait.. foosball champion is that you.
> The traveler of Benyon told me about you
> he said you are pivital to what happens next, he said your decision could change the course of history.

Camilla and Neil go to the Ironjaw residence to talk with Locke's father.

We are led into a room to give our account of what happened.
We are accompanied by Shane Flynn and the other guy we found in the torture basement.
Locke(Creed) gives the recollection of events.

The Demon of Duskar tells the scribe to stop scribing.
He tells us that the guild is required to be in the city.
Meaning the red balance.

> Maybe I should try starting a cult of the traveler
> Where I pop into random people's heads on the street and talk to them like a deity.
> Maybe then we could pose Bit as the messiah who can invoke the traveler.

Locke's father is one of the only men the Demon has any respect for.
He then says that his father is making a mistake.
Locke asks if he will be killed, Demon says don't just save him from the outcome, save me from having to execute one.

> Need Locke to explain that a bit more since I don't quite follow.

General Ferrick requests Duskar's presence as this happens.
