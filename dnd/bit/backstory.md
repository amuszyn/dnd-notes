Spellbinder Society

What did I do for money after?
Bounty hunter?
Worked on random farms?

Am I being Hunted?
I don’t know if I’m being hunted (and I shouldn’t know)
I feel uneasy getting on the boat
Could be a good first story line
If so
Is the hunter from the magical group?
Or from my travels around Benyon?

Family
What did they want to do with my family?
Secrets my parents kept?
Is my family alive?
What is my family name?
It’s something my parents never discussed
Could be the root to how we have a sorcerer in the family
With super high innate potential

Bit is a 45 year old half-elf that grew up in a small farming village in the hills of Benyon named the Cache. Many villages were a part of the villages of Benyon which all grew potatoes and carrots, as they were the only things that grew plentiful enough to make the families of the village enough money to get by.

The village was small and consisted of 5 other families all of which had many children to handle upkeep on their respected farms. Bit for instance was one of seven. He had 4 older brothers, 1 older sister, and a younger sister. Most of the children did chores in the mornings and then went to play with the other village kids in the afternoons before eating dinner and going to bed for the night. Most days consisted of the same routine as there wasn’t much to do around the area. The nearest village was a day's ride round trip and at the time what the villagers thought was a city was easily a 3 days ride past the aforementioned nearest village. Due to the circumstances the villagers were rather close and shared many things like weekly meals and picked up slack when families got ill.

During those afternoons the children's favorite games included those that challenged their bodies as they had grown rather athletic from their farming chores. These games were what all children looked forward to after the mornings including Bit until one day when he was 14 it all changed. It was just another day of sun in the sky, hardly any clouds when they were playing one of their default games: Tag. Bit had just gotten tagged from one of the older kids as he had a thousand times before and being one of the younger ones in the group looked to target one of the only kids younger: his sister. He made off and caught up with her rather quickly, due to their difference in size. As he made contact with her arm something coursed through him and his sister hit the ground seizing aggressively. As Bit’s older brother ran to their side he picked up their sister and sprinted back to their house only a few minutes away. As the days went on the sister stayed in a vegetative state where she would stay until her last day - Bit was silently blamed for it all.

A month after the incident a pair of elven men dressed in robes came to the door of Bit’s family. The robes were known to many as an esteemed magical group that operates out of this region of Benyon. They inquired about a magical disturbance in the area and when it became known that Bit was the cause they insisted they could help hone his abilities such that no one would get hurt by him again. It was with this information Bit was ecstatic to go with the group so he would never cause the same harm to anyone ever again. His sister passed away a few years after his departure, making him the youngest of his family.

Many years were spent with the magical group. After the first decade of training Bit traveled back every couple years to stay with his family for a season or two and then would return to the groups primary location where he would continue his.. work.

This continued and Bit was glad every time he was able to visit, despite never feeling quite at place anymore with his previous friends and siblings that seemed to grow more distant each time he returned. The only thing his village ever learned was that Bit worked with rare magical materials that were worth more than the village has seen since its inception. This was because the magical group kept each employee secretive by locking a piece of their memories in their mind each time they left to visit outsiders. This was in effort to keep trade secrets from leaving the company.. Or so they were told.

It was one of these visiting seasons when Bit was 35 that something odd had happened. In his pack he had an item with him that he had no recollection of what it could be. He reached in and touched the item hoping that maybe touching it would trigger some sort of memory to appear, but nothing did. He decided to keep the item and when he returned to the magical group would decide what to do with it as he would have his work specific memories unlocked.

Bit was awoken suddenly. A large booming noise sent a ringing sensation through his ears while a light that put the sun to shame reduced his vision to nothing but vague silhouettes. He knew there were a number of figures moving and as suddenly as he woke his sight vanished and he heard nothing - not even the trees in the wind, pure silence.

He woke again to nothing in sight but grass and a wide field - even his pack with the odd item was gone. It didn’t take long for him to recognize the field though, as it had the same hills as his family’s farmland. Bit tried to look for any trace of what had been before.. Before what he had seen. Which wasn’t much. After frantic searching he thought to travel to the neighboring village but when he got there no one had any recollection of a village ever being where he described. Many looked at him like a lunatic and others thought he was playing a trick on them. It was then Bit thought it must have been the magical group he worked for as he knew of their ability to remove memories. However he didn’t seem to remember how to get there, as he was escorted each and every time he traveled. Bit blames himself for what happened to his village and swore to dedicate his life to hunting the monsters who took his family from him.

Bit spent the last 8 years journeying around Benyon when he heard of a clue surface in the distant land across the Alabaster Sea in a city named [city we meet up in], the land he soon learned was named Daeon. It was then he spent the next 2 years traveling from Benyon to Daeon stopping in a plethora of villages and towns along the way. There were times he felt uneasy like someone was watching him from a distance. However, as a talented sorcerer fear was never something Bit encountered on his travels. Bit found a group of travelers headed to Daeon in a coastal city named (unknown) a couple were faces he recognized Dilmor and Axton a couple of dwarves met near the mountainous regions of Benyon during his search of the magical group. [Apparently in the last few years a bit of an uprising happened in the area causing a lot of Dwarves to seek refuge overseas].
