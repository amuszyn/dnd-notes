Eldric Moonbrooke: My old instructor from the spellbinder society.
I was able to see the workshop of the spellbinder society for the first time since my memories have been erased. A flood of memories come back but none significant enough to know why they would want to be hunting me.

How much is it going to cost to find him: My old instructor hired an assassin to get me. Why.

I can find him all I need is a name.

12 ft tall lengthy creature with a beak. I feel like I'm being watched again... just like those long nights alone and when I was on the boat. This makes me wonder why he hasn't struck yet.

Figure leans in close ; well be careful now for this is not a dream, well bit you seem to have caught the it, offers me a contract.

I sign the contract and get +1 lv 2 spellslot

Figure gets souls as long as I have my ring

>[!NOTE]
    My ring is a cerimonial ring given to me by Nodrac Ironarm, the heir to the largest most powerful dwarvish colony in Benyon
