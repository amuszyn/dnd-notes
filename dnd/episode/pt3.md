# Part 3

## Episode 30: Duality

We arrived at the church of Destin, a couple of days outside the capital city.
Strange creature known as Emissary:
the monster that touched Neil and went into his brain.
We obtained Cedric Tilly, the hairy frog.

Locke does his communion while we are reading folk lore in the library.

We are seeking the restricted section from the High Priestess
Some information about the intersection about Theos and Destin

Apparently the information is held in the 'fate valut' and isn't accessable to us.
It was described that this specific tome is very dangerous in the wrong hands.

Locke beins to explain his vision, lots of sand it formed into an hourglass.
Most of the sand was at the top, which makes him feel like hes not going to die.

We make our way to the inn because sebastion smells something rather odd in the garden

Neil wants to steal from the vault despite us saying not to.
Locke wants to flip a coin for it.

We get a room, numbered 18

I go into the fey realm and successfully find the space between awake and asleep.
I find myself being guided through the realm.
I fail to pass through but on my way out
I smell something, that I recognize as Samaroth's feet

Talking with Camilla after the journey I mention the smell
Samaroth's feet are what Sebastion smelled at the gardens

The vessil of samaroth has shown up at our door.
He had to be invited in the room
He claims to be the being that Samaroth made a pact with.
The demon Ky'Mytha

Part of the contract was that should he ever fall, the body becomes his.
When Samaroth was under the services he was given a mission;
Camilla apparently has something he needs. The ring of purgatory.

The demon was the one who pulled me deeper in the fey realm.
The demon also doesn't know how to remove the ring, but wants it after it is removed.
He also has information about the individual after Camilla.

Ky'Mytha claims to be of opposition of the fateweaver.
The intruder making his way into his realm, with his dreamers.

He knows where the ring can be removed, places beyond the material plane of course.
A place with a vast sort of... tinkerers.
If we are to take things further he needs a binding contract.
Tries to spin up a contract with all of us.

Lore about the ring:
When the universe was created the gods used the hells to seal away primordial beings.
Sealing them away into the Abyss,
there are 9 locked away into each realm of the hells
The Avernus used to be prison to a primal titan known as Ricta Zole,
slain by the gods before time began to flow.
In order to seal them away even the gods needed a conduit, or focus.
There was one made for each realm in the hells, and whoever controlled all the rings,
ruled over the hells, the rings were given to the god Bellacore,
who ruled over the hells for as long as time had flown.
This was until the veil was created, such a rift was so powerful it separated,
some of the material plane, the hells, the fey wild,
and the shadow realm to name a few.
When the veil dropped chaos ensued, and now that Bellacore has come back,
he intends to collect what is his.
Bellacore has made strange powerful friends and not a fight he wishes to be in.

The inbetween is his place, now Bellacore.
To travel between the hell realms you must pass through the inbetween.
Jumping between the fey and the material plane,
from jumping from fey to hell is hard.
The fey is one adjacent to the material plane.

Any time you teleport you momentarily pass through the inbetween.

Camilla insight checks Ky'Mytha successfully:
She knows a desperate move when she sees one.

Contract:
Once the ring is removed from Camilla it becomes Ky'Mytha's property.
We are responsible for the shipping. He will help.
Only way to break it is if we find a way to remove the ring and want to keep it.
We have a week after the ring leaves Camilla's finger.

Knowledge items:
The one hunting Camilla has been busy and fixed on Camilla.

Neil asks him where Oscar is, his exact location with proof.
Twisted Forest, which is where the fateweaver resides.

Right now Bellakor lays conquest onto the pandamonium, it will eventually be over.

Camilla, Locke, and Bit all sign the contract rather quickly.
He says that there shouldn't be any issue with the contract I currently hold.

Neil requests a round trip ticket to wherever his mother is when we give the ring.

> Bit now gets bonuses to his rolls when attempting to traverse the inbetween

The individual is the one that is currently tracking Camilla.
The individual approached him under the name Varys, still thinking he was Samaroth.
He claims to have been making friends lately.
He said that he has made a few friends from the north.
Ky'Mytha believes that he has made an accordance with Camilla's home.
He travels in a form that is unknown to Ky'Mytha, it is not teleportation,
but he is gone in the blink of an eye.

Camilla's ring might have much more power than percieved.

The Inbetween is a timeless place. There is no Map, its just a void.

He seems to know about the text relating to the When Death Marches.
He's placing the text around 1600 years in the past, it is bound in flesh.
The demon is unsure how to read the text - he is sure it is hidden somehow.

We can attempt to let Bit traverse himself through the Inbetween.

Ky'Mytha knows about the Spellbinder Society.
Mentions they are a newer organization (he is 36_000 years old).

Ky'Mytha says that there is no damage to Bit's brain.

Bit succeeds to traverse the Inbetween to obtain the text from the fate vault.

> First roll needed was 14, second was 18.
> Ky'Mytha gives a +5 and +3 for Arcana

## Episode 31: The Vault

I am pulled into somewhere dark for a moment, my senses falter.
I see the large hunched sickly green visige horned, with a large underbite.

> Rolled a 16 to get to the library vault

I am thrown through a portal, to a large metallic door.

> Torches are held by golden sticky tack

I hear movement, from either side of the doors.
Whichever one I take I enter the same room.
Sounds like mechanical guards.

I see a large set of heavy armor that seems to move on its own.
In the cracks I see etherial yellow hue.
Bound together by golden strings to form a humanoid form.
Back of the head is completely bald.
I cannot see its face,
but something is clearly coming out from the front of the head.

I approach a pedistal with a glass covering,
There is a well encrested compass on top of a pillow,
No NSEW, just the compass needle.
It slowly spins clockwise, comes to a hault and spin the opposite direction.
Etched into the sign, 'fate finders compass'

Hanging on the wall, I see a single bronze key.
Scribed is 'key of the timeless path'

The main big book is called 'the ever changing'

We see a portal, and through it we see a scene
A fairground, some guards there, many innocent people are shown
Then suddenly a high pitch ringing noise grows louder and louder
We can feel something arcane about it
The people in the streets begin to go mad with agression, feral

'You have the power to save all these people at the expense of anothers fate'

A simialr portal opens
A small child in Valeria, a child
This boy is destened to save his kingdom and thousands of lives
unfortunately he was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

'Would you save the life of the one lord destined to save his people,
or those impacted by a disaster that has already been'

They chose the boy and he did not respond in a hostile nature.

Now he wants a sacrifice.
To gain something you must lose something.
Offer something to Destin, something of value.

Things in the vault:

- Fatefinders compass
- Destin's eternal flame
- Key of the Timeless Path
- Fate Father's Ring
- The Ever Changing - Tome
- The Codex of Forgotten Destinies - Tome
- The Scroll of Banished Tomorrows - Tome

The Ever Changing:

The Chrono Vault, only those who know how to walk between moments can find it.
Risk unraveling the threads of reality.

## Episode 32: Half a stack

Right into combat, because Locke tried to steal a book

Warden -> Locke -> Bit -> Neil -> Camilla

Bit tries to steal, bit needs to get out of this somehow.

## Episode 33: Bitter Reunion

Fought the warden of the vault. Beat the warden.
Then we started looting everything in your path.
We = Bit

I then went invisible, sealing us all in the vault.

Bit returns the ring, deshrouds in front of the priestess and gets bound in the process.

As we exit, we see eight more guards outside.
This is odd because we don't know where they came from.
There were not this many people here before.
We are awkwardly escorted outside the walls of the church.

We are banned from the church because of Bit.

We have a horse and a mule and a wagon.

We travel and come across a very small town.
> Restrained -> cannot use Material or Somatic related things, hands are bound
> Tenticles give flanking

Neil wants to stop at a tiny mart to find stamps.
> Stamps are used in this world

As Neil is trying to grab a nic nack from this shop.
A character comes up behind him, a dwarf.
Locke sees him come behind Neil, and he says to Neil 'you almost fucking done kid'

Neil is given a fidget spinner.
Garen Joel is the dwarf that they meet.
He knows Locke's name is Creed.

He is with the Bitterbrew Accord.
Many of them scattered around the country.
They're all coming after us, and they're all looking for Locke.
He keeps talking about this Shane fellow.
Apparently he ran into someone named Blake.

Just two days ago Shane and Garen are making a supply run.
They came into contact with a Red Balance. They got Shane.

Garen has no clue why they want Locke so bad.
Locke doesn't give him anything, suggests his father maybe.

Red Balance are legal adjacent to the Dravenguard.
Dravenguard are paid off to look the other way.

To overthrow the Bitterbrew Accord they made some friends.
Blake knows more about the contact.
Blake should be set up somewhere in the woods.
They're looking for him because he's one of the last Brewmasters left.

Where was Garen 'that night', he responds with 'Living'

Locke accuses Garen of knowing they were going to be invaded.
Garen claims to be very loyal to his group.

How important is Shane, wouldn't be surprised if he's already dead.
We're going to go look for Blake.

> Oxford University exists in Benyon

We finally see in the distance large stone walls.
The city walls themselves are about 60 feet thick
It's a very busy place, lots are going on. We are in the common area.
Most buildings are made of stone, not much made of wood.
Looks like Minas Tirith. There are 4 tiers of the city.
We make our way to T2 of the city.
As we travel there is a building that looks akin to Krugers Charms and Arms.
Locke knows it is a magical shop. Quite a popular place, not the only one.
There is another one in T3. They don't just let anyone in to T3.
Status gets higher as you go up.

Large bazzar, exotic jewlery store, exotic clothing store.
Restaurant that has foreign cuisne.
Pop-up stand of different zodiac nic nacs.

There is a Blacksmith hub. Raised with stone pillars.
Tons of Dravenguard are around, the Blacksmith are making weaponry.
Normally there is a head of the Dravenguard as they patrol.
The group we see has a mixture of spellcasters, archers and others.
We notice a section only inhabited by golbin kin.
As we move through we see a mercinary/adventurers guild.

> JFK was killed by Red Balance, Jerimiah Frode Khan

Once we enter the T2 district, it is far less congested.
Still plenty of people but far less than the T1.

> Stable fee is 5 silver a night

Binx Brew, is something we want to ask for.
The Tavern's Name: The Gilded Gutter
A Ganesh looking dude is the bartender.

> Tavern is 6g night

Neil orders some milk with honey.
The bartender grabs the milk out of a bag of colding.
We order the Binx Brew and the bartender seems a bit surprised.
We find a table and stay a while.

## Episode 34: What Draven Holds

War is on the horizon and the king wants Locke(Creed)'s dad to participate

An elven woman escorts us behind the counter.
We hear very heavy breating, and the large elephant man is standing.
He has blood caked on his knuckles, we see two orcs beaten unconcious.
Orcish woman is loading the unconcious ones to take them away.
The back is much larger than the area we were just in.
In the middle there is a chalked out fighting pit.
We see a large bar, and many people placing bets on the fights to come.
We await to see the Gorefest v. Lobotomiser

We talk to a random person in the crowd, trying to figure out who to bet on.
He seems to know that the Lobotomiser
is 2x the size of the last guy he just fought so we bet on him.

Neil begins talking with Velen to join the fight ring.
Neil thinks he can take Thunderpunch.

Locke sees his brother, he runs and falls in front of Locke.
Locke claims to have been on vacation.

Neil is trying to give away 1k gold to bet on himself.
This Thunderpunch is gonna kill him.
Lobotomiser is a huge dude.
Gorefest looks like a tiny lean dude that's already fucked up.
His fists look hard and strong.
Lobotomiser wins - Valen yells ENOUGH as Lobotomiser takes it a little far.

Valen reveals a Farlander Platinum piece worth 1k gold.

Apprently Locke knows that Sayless is the bar maid.

> Camilla is racist

Sayless is a changeling, Locke and her go back to when he fought at the bar.

Red Balance has had whispers of a 'Rat Jaw' being mentioned.
All rumors of course.

Bit successfully teleports to the foreign cuisine place, kindof.
He ended up in the allyway near it, then walked back to the tavern.

We enter `Arcane Trinket and Dodads`
Finnick Whisp

We enter `The Molten Anvil`

## Episode 35: Last Stop

> First Joe Episode

Locke had a reunion with his father and his little brother Flint.

Nox: 6'3 270, long white hair human, decent sized white beard. Icy blue eyes. Leather armor, tunic with some axes.

Neil notices a partially hidden tattoo, he recognizes this symbol as the Red Balance.

We discuss a proposition with Nox and he seems to have left the Red Balance.
He has a wife and his son was stolen from him by the Balance.
Locke has a contact that says the Red Balance has some stuff in the north.

We make our way to Locke's house to eat dinner with his family.
He doesn't believe his father has any association
with Galescar or The Oracalcum Exchange.

Father Ironjaw is a large orc with a cloth tied around his eyes.

> [!info] Talking With Ironjaw
> Does he know anything about magical organizations?
> Does he know anything regarding the Oracalcum Exchange?
> Do you know anything about Galescar?

Nox see's one of the blue crows.

Triss Goldheart, joined the family business.
She's somewhere in the city.

Tenth of Menaros - the ball episode, lots of influential people will be there.

King is having a formal event to celebrate his return.
It's there so he can make a proper declaration of war.
Apparently he has an important announcement.

Upper tier entry is only permitted to those that are recognized by the guards.
You have to know the right people.
As he is talking there is a lound knock at the door..

Duskar walks into the dinner party.

Locke's dad is not a fan of Duskar at all.

'You know this brings me no pleasure, but he's your king too'

Whatever it is Ferrick won't do it.

Neil blows his whole load on the kid's face.
(He casts healing spells on Flint's face)

Sebastion has been serving Camilla for 165 years 3 months 5 days
Camilla has been alive less than 350 years.

Nox knows where they would take to interrogate people (wonder why)
There is no single prison, there are locations based on security level.
The more secured the closer to the center of the city.

We take the night to sleep at the tavern, Noxx stays up to work and close the tavern.

The cold man, comes in looking like a full blooded orc. He freezes Matilda.

He embodies cold, Bit walks downstairs unnoticed and turns around to wake everyone.
Noxx levitates him and hits him with a barstool like a baseball bat
attempting to knock him out of the bar.

There is a small explosion and ice comes below the door.
We go outside to see the familiar body of Hagus (the regular).
There is ice everywhere around the bar.

Hagus was transmuted, I've only seen this a few times.
His bones are poped and shifted in ways that were not ment to be.

Guards show up to investigate the commotion.

Craig the Dravenguard is reporting this incident to Duskar.

The guards who interviewed us are named Steve, Buschemi

> [!note] Ending thoughts
> As the session comes to an end we decide to talk with Locke's contact Blake.
> We also will look to do some recon of the northern camp
> that is if Blake doesn't know anything about it.
