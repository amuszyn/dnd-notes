# Solo Notes

Eldric Moonbrooke: My old instructor from the spellbinder society.
I was able to see the workshop of the spellbinder society for the first time since my memories have been erased. A flood of memories come back but none significant enough to know why they would want to be hunting me.

How much is it going to cost to find him: My old instructor hired an assassin to get me. Why.

I can find him all I need is a name.

12 ft tall lengthy creature with a beak. I feel like I'm being watched again... just like those long nights alone and when I was on the boat. This makes me wonder why he hasn't struck yet.

Figure leans in close ; well be careful now for this is not a dream, well bit you seem to have caught the it, offers me a contract.

I sign the contract and get +1 lv 2 spellslot

Figure gets souls as long as I have my ring

>[!NOTE]
    My ring is a cerimonial ring given to me by Nodrac Ironarm, the heir to the largest most powerful dwarvish colony in Benyon
Bit leaves Nodrac, he will be in town for 2 days. We need to get together, he will show up at the last stop.
Bit mentioned that he was aquanted with Evern Vander.
Also mentioned I was here with General Ozen.
Which is a massive deal.

## During the Royal Event

I make my way over to Eldric.
Eldric is older for an elf. 4 to 5 hundred.
My link fails to reach him.
He plays dumb, claims he does not know who I am.
I mention that I am a survivor from the lost village Cache.
He attempts to charm me by touch. I barely pass the check.
His face distorts.
Ky'Mytha speaks in my mind: Do not fall for his tricks.

----

We begin chatting at a table as Noxx attends to the tavern.
We exchange our days experiences and Locke explains the gyroscope he found.

Neil is putting forward a great performance knocking peoples socks off.

I approach a half elven man alone at a table after we have a short mental conversation.

Finest elven vintage the valerian vassal wine.
Eldric is the half elven man in disguised.

He says the name Cache.
He speaks of it in a reminicing manner.
I helped build something incredible.
Apparently we were visionaries.

Do you know how rare you are.
A survivor. Magic hums with the echo of something.
Cornerstone of a process that could change everything.
And yet the memories are scattered arent they.
Not quite gone but elusive like whispers in the dark.
Trauma can fray the edges of the mind especially when done by magical means.
Perhaps it was a mercy.

The town didn't die.. it shifted.
Something went wrong yes, but wrong isn't always meaningless.
What happened in Cache was the first step to a brighter stronger future.
One that needs you.
He sets something on the table but does not reveal it.
As he lifts his hand he reveals a familiar piece of octagonal oracalcum he gave the king as tribute.
He has higher duties now, lots of secrts in his care.

> Bit obtains a piece of octagonal oracalcum

When I'm ready to remember -- just know I cannot undo what has already transpired.
A man will lose himself trying to correct the past.

Should I ever want to return to a higher purpose, I need only to reach out.

He pulls out a piece of scratch paper and writes something on it and gives it to me.
An encantation written in elvish: Zerith Varr
I know translates to: To find and seek

You need not tangle yourself in the mistakes of your crew.

Everything in my body feels dark, I feel like the memories are right there.
Information is certainly being withheld.
