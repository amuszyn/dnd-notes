# Part 4 of the epic journey

> Maybe I should try starting a cult of the traveler
> Where I pop into random people's heads on the street and talk to them like a deity.
> Maybe then we could pose Bit as the messiah who can invoke the traveler.

Locke's father is one of the only men the Demon has any respect for.
He then says that his father is making a mistake.
Locke asks if he will be killed, Demon says don't just save him from the outcome, save me from having to execute one.

> Need Locke to explain that a bit more since I don't quite follow.

General Ferrick requests Duskar's presence as this happens.

## Episode 39: Return of the King

Camilla feeds, on the 8th of Manaros.

Someone knocks on the door, while Camilla and Neil are still inside.
He identifies himself as the tutor for Flint.

Ferrick agreed, that he would return.
Assuming this means as a general.

The king is a mad man, he lies and only looks out for himself.
Gregor(Demon of Duskar), apparently is the kings puppet. Hes not from this country, hes only here to cause havoc.

Flint's tutor was a disguise for the frost guy that has been chasing Camilla.

Another voice comes, 'enough of these games, come and get what you want - so I can get what I want'

The three of them, Camilla, Neil, and Flint.
Jump out of the window while levatating and hit a tree on the way out.
A strong looking figure with a large sword refers to Camilla as 'my lady' and says 'you will be coming with me'

Camilla see's another robed figure in the distance as she tries to spirderman rope pull away.

After the meeting with the king, its likely that the fighting will begin in Crimea.

The guy in the house jumps out, and picks Flint up by the shirt. Tells him to hold tight.
Another voice from the hooded figure, tells the Knight to put his damn hand down.

The pale knight is a vampire.

The Pale Knight summoned the frost dragon during our combat.
We are doing ok in combat then the dragon came down and shot a blast of frost.
Downing Neil and harming a lot of our team.

Neil iradicates the knight with a radiant blast (2x) critically for 68pts of damage.

The frosty tiefling dimension doors away.
Dragon gets away flying off into the Galescar mountains.

Gregor and guards approach and Ferrick explains things.
Neil and Locke stay.

### Part 2

Ebon Echo, while holding can use an action to tune in your hearing to listen in on whispers up to 100ft. Once used its down till next dawn.
Its a bug to overhear people.

We go out to gamble since we have time before the ball tomorrow.
We also need to go by Ozen's hotel before tomorrow.

One of the fighters has a rare collectable. An Automaton of sorts.

Noxx and Locke are going to fight in 4 hours (its 9am) so we go to see Ozen in our small break in time.

We are going in as the security detail for Ozen. Neil is going in as her nephew.
For running security we are making 400g each.

Noxx and Locke are preparing to fight.

Bit goes to bet on his friends in the upcoming fights.

Evil Eye v. Meat Loaf -> 100g
Evil Eye (Locke) won and I gained net 130g
Lobatamizer v. The Roc -> 100g

This fight is much closer, but Noxx just never took damage.
Overall made 260g, but half of one is going to Noxx,
So I made 195g and Noxx gets 65g.

We go to buy our ball attire, I scalp my voucher for 100g and use disguise self to create my fancy attire.

As we leave the Worn Wardrobe, we see a sky ship floating across. Used by the farlanders.

Tom Cruise - My first diciple, a fisherman living outside the city.

I need to send any future followers towards Tom Cruise.
We will start our own church and reap the rewards.

Locke goes to get a drink with Gregor.
They talk about what will happen next with Ferrick being back in action.
Gregor was approached by a strange figure named The Fatewaver.
He offered Gregor a contract, giving him borrowed power for souls.
Gregor denied the offer, but he could smell the intentions.
Such a dubious offer certainly had more up his sleeve.

The King knows a little about the changelings.
He seemed perplexed by their involvement in the current game.
Unsure why fey are popping out, maybe blaming Crimea.
Fisk is no warrior like Ozen or Ferrick.

We then go to bed for the night.

> This is now the day of the ball.
> The morning after the ball Camilla and Bit need to attend the mage's guild to get in.

We are now just outside the gates of tier 3.
People are being checked to enter the tier.
Ozen makes her way over with Ferrick.
Ozen has a blazer/suit on.

> Ozen is gay

We end entering tier 3.
