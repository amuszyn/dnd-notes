# Part 4 of the epic journey

> Maybe I should try starting a cult of the traveler
> Where I pop into random people's heads on the street and talk to them like a deity.
> Maybe then we could pose Bit as the messiah who can invoke the traveler.

Locke's father is one of the only men the Demon has any respect for.
He then says that his father is making a mistake.
Locke asks if he will be killed, Demon says don't just save him from the outcome, save me from having to execute one.

> Need Locke to explain that a bit more since I don't quite follow.

General Ferrick requests Duskar's presence as this happens.

## Episode 39: Return of the King

Camilla feeds, on the 8th of Manaros.

Someone knocks on the door, while Camilla and Neil are still inside.
He identifies himself as the tutor for Flint.

Ferrick agreed, that he would return.
Assuming this means as a general.

The king is a mad man, he lies and only looks out for himself.
Gregor(Demon of Duskar), apparently is the kings puppet. Hes not from this country, hes only here to cause havoc.

Flint's tutor was a disguise for the frost guy that has been chasing Camilla.

Another voice comes, 'enough of these games, come and get what you want - so I can get what I want'

The three of them, Camilla, Neil, and Flint.
Jump out of the window while levatating and hit a tree on the way out.
A strong looking figure with a large sword refers to Camilla as 'my lady' and says 'you will be coming with me'

Camilla see's another robed figure in the distance as she tries to spirderman rope pull away.

After the meeting with the king, its likely that the fighting will begin in Crimea.

The guy in the house jumps out, and picks Flint up by the shirt. Tells him to hold tight.
Another voice from the hooded figure, tells the Knight to put his damn hand down.

The pale knight is a vampire.

The Pale Knight summoned the frost dragon during our combat.
We are doing ok in combat then the dragon came down and shot a blast of frost.
Downing Neil and harming a lot of our team.

Neil iradicates the knight with a radiant blast (2x) critically for 68pts of damage.

The frosty tiefling dimension doors away.
Dragon gets away flying off into the Galescar mountains.

Gregor and guards approach and Ferrick explains things.
Neil and Locke stay.

### Part 2

Ebon Echo, while holding can use an action to tune in your hearing to listen in on whispers up to 100ft. Once used its down till next dawn.
Its a bug to overhear people.

We go out to gamble since we have time before the ball tomorrow.
We also need to go by Ozen's hotel before tomorrow.

One of the fighters has a rare collectable. An Automaton of sorts.

Noxx and Locke are going to fight in 4 hours (its 9am) so we go to see Ozen in our small break in time.

We are going in as the security detail for Ozen. Neil is going in as her nephew.
For running security we are making 400g each.

Noxx and Locke are preparing to fight.

Bit goes to bet on his friends in the upcoming fights.

Evil Eye v. Meat Loaf -> 100g
Evil Eye (Locke) won and I gained net 130g
Lobatamizer v. The Roc -> 100g

This fight is much closer, but Noxx just never took damage.
Overall made 260g, but half of one is going to Noxx,
So I made 195g and Noxx gets 65g.

We go to buy our ball attire, I scalp my voucher for 100g and use disguise self to create my fancy attire.

As we leave the Worn Wardrobe, we see a sky ship floating across. Used by the farlanders.

Tom Cruise - My first diciple, a fisherman living outside the city.

I need to send any future followers towards Tom Cruise.
We will start our own church and reap the rewards.

Locke goes to get a drink with Gregor.
They talk about what will happen next with Ferrick being back in action.
Gregor was approached by a strange figure named The Fatewaver.
He offered Gregor a contract, giving him borrowed power for souls.
Gregor denied the offer, but he could smell the intentions.
Such a dubious offer certainly had more up his sleeve.

The King knows a little about the changelings.
He seemed perplexed by their involvement in the current game.
Unsure why fey are popping out, maybe blaming Crimea.
Fisk is no warrior like Ozen or Ferrick.

We then go to bed for the night.

> This is now the day of the ball.
> The morning after the ball Camilla and Bit need to attend the mage's guild to get in.

We are now just outside the gates of tier 3.
People are being checked to enter the tier.
Ozen makes her way over with Ferrick.
Ozen has a blazer/suit on.

> Ozen is gay

We end entering tier 3.

## Episode 40: Fear no longer

> Locke's workshop at his dad's place will be done in a week.

We enter Tier 3.
The things we see on our way to Tier 4.
Gilded Thorn, lounge and gambling
Azure Ascendency.
The Vault of Revelry, magic shop & enchantments
Everlight Conservitory,
Obsidan Tribunal, law and negotians guild
Moonlit Mascarade, grand ball room and social club
Aric Dominion, bank of the elite
Dragons Veil, magic attire store

They aren't taking weapons but they are taking notes of what we are bringing in.
They are 'TSA' checking us.

Red crests of Benyon are on many attendees.
There is a party of people near the front.
Bypassing the line, they don't bear any attire from this contenent.
They are very well armored, about 20 of them.
They are clearly covering up someone.
The soldier units of Valeria, Valerian Arrancar.

Ozen identifies them as Valerians, they're likely here to be with the King.

We make it through TSA and are escorted through large castle doors.
The castle is armed to the teeth.
Cannons, magical apparatus.

We make it to the main area.
Enormous, football field size.
Built to entertain the masses, there is an elegant throne at one end.
Crested with blue saphires and other gem stones.
It sits empty now, but there are some royal guards around funneling people into their designated areas.

The security is massive because of the dragon incident we were in.

As the stream of people dies down, the Giddy 9, all gnomes starts playing
We hear the banjo as they begin.
A very well dressed half orc walks down the stairs.
He's clearly military, he's talking to someone from the mages guild.
The mage casts a wordless incantation, and the man's voice is now broadcast.
Lieutendat Fisk Graypool is the half orc's name.
King will not join till supper time.
Special thanks to the oraclcum exchange for funding the venture.
Courtyard is accessable, everywhere else is off limits.

> Doom Scrolling, referrs to reading a scroll that is doomed to never end.

The Red Hand is here, Kessera.
She takes note of Noxx from across the room.

Bit goes to look for a table of dwarves.

Ferrick and Fisk catch up as they are long friends.
They served in the Crima war together as two of the main generals.
They were also with the Demon of Duskar, Gregor, and Ozen.
Fisk takes Ferrick away for a private conversation.
There is some Benyon attire, however no Crimean.

Gregor Ironclad enters the room. Fully armored.
Lord Darius Falcrest, of house Falcrest.
Very formal, no weapons. Accompanied by a similarly dressed party.

Bit notices a table, that has some Benyon colors.

Camilla hasn't had many friends.
Some arranged relationships.

The Red Hand, has a helmet on and confronts Noxx.
She stares at him and they exchange formalities.

Leonardo Oswald, Tinkerer of the King.
Tormid Brawn, Rhomulas Rhombus.

Lady Vivian Moville, house Moville.
Human with brown hair, exotic pelts and tusks as earrings.
Emissaries from Benyon, Nodrac Ironarm, Eldric Moonbrooke, Azriel Valdrake.

Neil begins talking with a memeber of the oracalcum exchange.
Eva Silvershore, the gentlemen lets Neil talk with her and goes to get some drinks.

Bit gets with Nodrac Ironarm. They catch up for a bit.
Nodrac has a large amount of income coming in at the moment.

Emissaries from Crimea, Prince Shrad Redel, eldest son of Queen.
Albus Silvershore, rep from their family.

Crimean Emissaries were not expected, however Nodrac knew they were to come.

Apparently the Crimean emissaries are the least surprising.
Crimea, Farland, and Valeria are expected.

An elven figure with extremely long silver hair.
Reserved attire, which is odd given the circumstance.
Emissary from Valeria, Ulquiorra (ulk-i-ora) Cypher.

Locke starts talking with Fisk. He starts poking fun at Ferrick.
Locke isn't the army type but he claims to be getting his name out there.
Ferrick asks where Neil is. He needs to have a word with him.

Emissaries from the Farlands, Xavary Lighttouch, Brodan Freljord
Six heavily armored guards with horns extending from their helmets.

Red Hand knows who the tiefling is. Not her friend apparently.
She wants to discuss something with Noxx.
The Red Hand knows that his son is missing.
She knows he will do anything to get his son back.
She has one final job for him. Shes bribing him a bit.
Wants nothing to do with him or his kid.
Direction comes from the Scale.
She tells him to bring her the Scale's head.
Malrick (The Scale), has gotten rather ambitious.
Always trying to see the purpose beyond.
The organization has lost a bit of its way in her eyes.
His leadership has lost sight of these original intentions.
She blames the Tiefling.
The offer is for Malrick's head, she will give the location of the northern camp.
This is likely where his son is.
She wants the job of The Scale.

Bit leaves Nodrac, he will be in town for 2 days. We need to get together, he will show up at the last stop.
Bit mentioned that he was aquanted with Evern Vander.
Also mentioned I was here with General Ozen.
Which is a massive deal.

I make my way over to Eldric.
Eldric is older for an elf. 4 to 5 hundred.
My link fails to reach him.
He plays dumb, claims he does not know who I am.
I mention that I am a survivor from the lost village Cache.
He attempts to charm me by touch. I barely pass the check.
His face distorts.
Ky'Mytha speaks in my mind: Do not fall for his tricks.

Please rise for your king, of Daein and Tellius.
King Ashnard.
Wearing the most ornate garb ever seen.
Large draping blue cape.
Human figure, old man. At least 75.
Hair is sparse and thin. Pure white where it exists.
Large crown, comedically large for his head.
The crown is esquisite, lodeded with rare gemstones.

He then settles the applause.
Thank you all for joining us tonight. It has been sometime since I have been home.
I want to give thanks to Lieutenant Fisk and Gregor.
We will begin with our emissaries offerings before we move forward.

The people are coming up giving cerimonial gifts.
Eldric Moonbrooke, sets down a large basket.
We see a large pile of refined oracalcum.
Chiseled into an octoganal shape.
They are further refined by the spellbinder society.
The spellbinder society remains at the service of Imperia.

The Farlanders are up.
Brodan Freljord, and Xavary Lighttouch.
No one is applauding.
They walk up without gifts, and without guards.
Brodan speaks first, hesitates, sweat beading down his forehead.
He then fails to speak, and gestures Xavary to speak.
Xavary admits to his lack of offering.
He then offers words of wisdom in exchange.
The king claims knowledge is the best offering.
He is rather intrigued of what farlanders have to say.

Rumors have spread to the seven relams of his intentions.
The farlands, have no intent of a quarrel with any of the countries outside of them.
From their perspective, it is a very confusing time.
He is claiming that the attacks were not theirs.
He assures that they have nothing to steal.
He wants the king to know this is not a plea for mercy.

Some of the facts about the farlands are true.
Many of our lands are wartorn, diety have risen and fallen.
Enemies alike rising in the lands.
Our people are hardened and tired.
We aren't ready for another conflict.
Xavary has known the king for a time, and he sent him with a message.
It is probably unknown to everyone in the room, but the deathless occupy the island of Easten.

> Easten is in the Alabaster sea.

The meaning is that they have taken the island in just one day.
His gift to the king is, do not start a war with a nation that has only known it.

The Emissaries of Crimea are up.

Prince Shrad, walks up. No older than 26.
He says, your grace. You do me much honor to extend the invite.
Especially in our troubling times.
I do bear boons. Unlike the farlanders.
He places a pendant of Theos.
Said to belong to the deity herself.
Been in his family for 9 generations.
As well as a few kind words;
You must understand the position I am in being here.
But my mother the queen, she made it a point,
to avoid any sort of conflicts at any cost.
We need not a repeat of the bloodshed that happened 20 years ago.
We are beyond any of these simple quarrels, and any rumors of us working with the farlanders is false.
Our allegiance is to Tellius and the king.
The queen is willing to forego Crimea's next rotation of the crown.
If you can assure us that things will not turn out the way they did before.

> The prince is visibly nervous while delivering this message.

The king commends him for his bravery, and his plea.
Names him honorable, Gregor scoffs.

The final emmisary, Ulquiorra Cypher.
He stands and looks at the king without kneeling.
Your highness, you do Valeria the honor of inviting us here today.
I wish for our relationship to stay fruitful.
Then walks away with no reaction from the King.

The king then addresses the masses.
I wanted to thank everyone for coming.
Words escape him at the moment.
Farlanders you show courage and bravery as well, even with the harsh words.
Truely I thank you for coming.
Seeing is believing as they say. Young man, he looks at the Crimean prince.
For too long Daein, has lived in fear of the once dominant Crimea.
While Daein may hold power for now, historically Crimea has held the power.
Even when the crown changed they were economically ahead.
The three separate kingdoms don't need to be too separated, we are all under Tellius.

The prince agrees that the separation is merely formality.

Some decisions do not come easily.
I dont throw away declartions of war or accusations lightly.
May this moment be the death of the past.
He brings the Crimean boy in his arms.
Still addressing the crowd, no longer shall we live in fear.
No longer shall we fear eachothers colors.
From this day forward, we must act as one.
So I call to you emissaries, all who have come.
Observe as our fear, vanishes.
He then sinks the blade into the Crimean prince.

The Crimean gurads are littered with crossbow bolts.
The royal guards take out their blades, and the prince rolls down the stairs gurgling his own blood.

No longer shall Daein fear another.
If there is one thing I will do with my legacy, I will be the man to unite Tellius.
We have been in development of our own technologies.
Of our own means of protections.

The king commands to lock up the Farlanders and to kill the others.
The deathless are fighting the royal guards.
Brodan and Xavary are tackled and bound by the guards.

The prince takes his final breath.
We then see the soulpulled out as it is sucked into the weapon of the king.
Our army has been blessed with boons from other realms.
Our generals stand at our side.
There will be no more separation, from this day forward we are the kingdom of Tellius.
Any who deny that will suffer the consequences.

General Ferrick, rise.
He walks to the king.

Take your rightful place at my side.
Fisk would be happy to return to your command.
Your betallion awaits you, would you not shed blood, do what you were born to do.

Ferrick tries to find the words.
I can't is all he mutters.
I can't be that man anymore.

The king, takes a step forward.
Duskar told me of your intentions.
You were an honorable general, why would you make such decisions.

Ferrick says;
Once you have walked as many battlefields as I have.
You see all the bodies, tens of thousands.
They begin to follow you.

The king says:
Ask those men that lost their lives what their honor did for them.
Their silence is the answer.

Ferricks time of warfare is behind him, he has a family.
He would be willing to serve, just not on the battlefields.

You undestand the consequences of your actions do you not.

Staring at his son, Ferrick says: that I do.
At that time Ferrick is arrested for treason against the king.
Ozen is instructed to arrest him.
She sits in her chair. For a moment does nothing.
Then says; Yes my king.

They take him to Coldharbor.

Duskar's eyes are bloodshot. Fixed on Ferrick.

Let it be known that today we fear no longer.
This is the dawn of a new Tellius.
And whether it be farlander, crimea, or anything else, you are not above the law.
I thank you all for joining me tonight.
And look forward to our future discussions.

He then walks back up the stairs.
The room dead silent.
Fisk then speaks up, thanking everyone for attending the return of the king.

He is rather nervous, not knowing what to say.
As he has to deal with the crowd that just got all this dropped on them.

## Episode 41: Embers

We left our pets with Doug.

Bit met with Nordrac Ironarm and Eldric Moonbrooke.
King is involved with the fateweaver as when he killed the Crimean, his soul was visibily transferred.

Ozen called Bit on the stone ear.
We have much to talk about, time is short. We must meet tomorrow at 20:00 Tellius Eastern Timezone (TET).

Bit and Camilla start traveling to the Mage's guild at 03:30 TET

The group goes to the Bitterbrew guy, Blake to return the EbonEcho. They get 2k gold.

He wants to give them some history.

Captain Trusk Stillbane, he's no one that notable.
Locke has heard his father mention this figure before.
Worked under him like lietenant Fisk.
Trust was present during the battle of the burning keep.
There is a theory that the captain may have had an alliegance elsewhere.
Outside of Tellius.
His source has a connection to the Trusk. A Valerian captain.
He things the captain was given an order from an outside force.
Not sure what the outside force is but there is a name:Ulquiorra Cypher
There is no mention of the captain anywhere.
During this week period before Stillbane went missing.
He thinks he had a few personal run ins with the king.
Very buddy buddy with the king. Anecdotal evidence.
This is all to hopefully figure out what happened to Ferrick's eyes.

A name is given, Espada.
It was mentioned once in an old text.
When Valeria was at its height, its golden age.
Before the Veil or Tellius was up.
The reason they came up with Espada, is because there was a correlation in their degrees of separation.

There are few Bitterbrew Accord members left.
Only a single above Blake in rank.
Locke lets Blake know about their plan to end The Scale.

Camilla and Bit hear a booming voice in their heads.
They passed the first challenge for the Mage's guild.
Now we are being tested on cooperation.
Many stations appear out of thin air.
We must understand that magic is not memorization, it is manifistation.
We must make a new spell.
Panel of judges will judge us.

Rules:
The spell must have:
A concept: protection, vitality, murder, needs a name.
A material rep: Material objects, the council will choose one.
We need to work one into the spell:

- Magic Bean
- Iron Chain
- Brass Tooth

A verbal componenet: The incantation must be 2 lines long. A sentance by each player. Have to be said back to back. Need a rhyme scheme.
A jesture: Must describe the physical gesture to perform the spell. We cannot do the same gesture.

Concept: Protection of the bean.
Material: Bean
Verbal: By the Bean, may protection be seen.
Jesture: Camilla upward motion, Bit plants the bean.

Vote of 2-1 we were judged to stay in the guild.

We are initiates of the guild within the city.

>We get a scroll of the `protection of the bean`.
>It can be used as a reaction.
>Instantly destroyed when it takes damage.
>We can cast with spell slots up to level 9.
>For every level we cast, it increases the girth(radius) of the beanstalk by 1 square.
>Height goes up 10ft at lv 1.
>Gains 5ft every level after.
>At level 9 it goes 500ft in the sky.
> Spell slots are additive. (ie. Camilla casts at 3, and Bit casts at 5 = level 8)

Varen walks over, to answer our questions.
The headmaster tells Camilla to set up a meeting with Varen.
Meet at the guild.
It's almost 16:00, been here 12 hours.
We both get access signets to the guild hall.
Master Rogar is a hardball.
If he is scared, be on your best behavior.

They have magical enscribing work.
Slave labor for credit.

For work we can talk to Magus Pesk.
He's a strange fellow, but he has a bright mind.

> We have a meeting with Ozen at 20:00

Locke and Sebastion have a one on one conversation.
Sebastion asks for help with his issues.
He wants to not be a cat again.
His body is North..
He gives Locke his name Nixengor.

Neil is contacted by Elana Indigo.
She's back from her trip, she needs him to go to Stonemarsh.
She discovered a lot.
She will be in Dravenhold in a few hours.
