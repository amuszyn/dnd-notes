# Post combat

## Long Rest

1. Lock + Camilla
2. Neil + Samaroth
3. Bit

Lock only has 49 ft of rope. Improvised molitov

Last watch gets long rest during watch -- logistics op

## Long Rest Completed

Lock rolls `12` for encounter and we meet an orc with some food
We buy 50 camp supplies for `7 Gold`, we then move on for the final day.
Something about a huge mushroom - Neil makes a good History roll: A lot of gnomes live in large mushrooms but this one is gnarly and doesnt look like it's going to be one of the ones that gnomes live in.

Big mushroom guy asks who we are.
Samaroth is leading conversation, the big weird guy's name is: Nyrn Silverstring, we are here for the mushrooms job.

He rambles on about talking animals and comes back with his mosset coat, living moss on the side, walks with a dank rod looking stick. Hes going to take us to the warehouse an hour from his house. 'Perfect timing' is said because it's almost dusk.

You can only get into the warehouse at night. The other groups didn't believe him which is why they left.

Are dragons normally in this region: History check says that they have never seen dragons in this reagion.
This guy has an affliction for mushrooms - we dont have a name for this team.

Man picks cat up: Why cant the guy go get him? He says hes not prepared to go into the warehouse. And that he is not prepared. There are many small voices inside the warehouse.
He dosent seem to want to come with us.
What happens if we don't come back before day - cant get back until the next day.
Master is also a Gnome - they live a long time.

- Very old fart.
Why is he stuck in the warehouse?
- He always told Nyrn that it could take him a long time to leave. But it has been 8 months and hes getting concerned.
Very aware of the `Throne of Eternity Conflict`
- Calendar system is based on this
- The throne of eternit refers to the places where aternus the creator resides this place is not a plane of existance it exists oitside the realm of idea. Until Imperious the god of order and then went god of tyranny - assembled other minor deities to support him and thought to ascend to claim the throne of Eternity and end chaos. A bunch of gods had conflicting ideas. A thousand year war waged. all places except inside the veil.
- Old story and there is a bit of random stuff thrown in and many renditions.
- A thousand years of unrecorded history.

Master's Name: The Great Taterthorn the Timeless.

Points to smoke in the distance and up ahead is the warehouse.

We begin to hear a singing voice, in a language we don't understand - pudgey bald dwarf - small shack is all his home.
Really bad living conditions - hes sitting on a log saying 'waard'. He knows Nyrn gives him a hug. His name is Waard apparently.

He passes out and his body transforms into a large building. He is the warehouse. Its a grandious building.

We all went into the building and vanished from the plane.
Telepathic connection to Severath was severed. So its a different dimention.
Hes the potato mage? apparently not sure what this means.

## Dungeon Paths

directions

1. large set of stairs to an upper floor
2. bottom floor - basement room
3. main floor - strange hexagonal door
4. left wall - rectangular door, horizontal

sunset: 20:00, 6:00 sun will come (12 hrs) and the warehouse will

Camilla takes `14` damage from potato explosion

Wondering if Bit knows anything about this mage..
The door we came in no longer teleports us out. So we are locked in this place.

`Taterthorn Tott` - can be consumed for 1 camping supplies, eaten as BA for `1` hp. When 2 of them come into contact with eachother they deal `1d12` of starch damage each

The potatoes can be disarmed by cutting off a piece
We head to the hexagonal door - Neil grabs the door and his body expands - teleports to another area.

We are all lv 4 now.
