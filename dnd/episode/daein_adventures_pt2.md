# Episode 18: The Nest

Landed on the mysterious island, found a weird town Oscar got weird, the crew is weird, there is a cave and the island is alive. Camilla got attacked by a nervous system.
Our ship got sunk by Broderick, a changeling that knew Oscar by Karaxus, we questioned him and Oscar teleported away. Our new changeling prisoner spoke about seeing airships near the island hoping to escape with them. He noticed a ring on Bits finger that shifted his gaze. Called me a 'dreamer'.

Kethadok is the changeling's name.

We go to kill the villagers in a sneaky fashion.

Locke asks why I am the dreamer, apparently Bit has been chosen to fill the infinite well. The infinite well is a place, a thing he supposes. If we survive he will give us more information.

Combat begins as the Changeling hurls a fireball at us dealing 31 to Neil and 15 to everyone else.

#### Initiative Order

1. Locke
2. Neil
3. Changeling
4. Bit
5. Nervous Systems
6. Camilla

>[!IMPORTANT]
    Grapple is an athletics check

After we finish the battle we go to sleep at the shore to long rest.
Oscar appears at the shore during Locke's watch and says that he is not responsible for what happened at Stonemarsh.

Camilla goes on a racist changeling rant, Oscar says that Ozen knows of his status.

Bit talks with Oscar while the others bicker, I tell him that I trust him and that Camilla is simply not a welcoming person despite being a vampire...

Oscar goes into story telling about why my being a dreamer is bad. He is from the fey realm, time flows differently there. All the changelings serve one of the archfey beings, near divine levels of power. They have abilities that can manipulate the whole fey realm. Among them is one, more ambitious than the rest. One title that can be taken instead of earned, to see what is to come before it comes to know what path lies before you. This is the job left only to The Fateweaver. The changelings served the fateweaver: Kyros for many years all in his long quest to fill his well of infinite souls. He has been finding champions and blessing them with gifts for hundreds of years. These champions became known as dreamers. There is another piece that is important, there is a name to this changeling organization, the leaders name is Seravok.

What is the fateweaver having them do.

Hes trying to gather these souls for something. He is assuming he plans to do something with the boy. It has been foretold it has been fated.

Ozen took Oscar in after the Daein, Crimea war. He is working against Seravok. Ozen thinks that Seravok is trying to start a war, not the first time he's done it. Also seems like it may be an inside job.

# Episode 19: What lies below

While traveling to the cave that we are looking for, Bit finds a small crack in the ground.

We get into the caverns and find a spiral staircase. We go down the staircase and enter a mysterious hallway with dismembered corpses.

Locke identifies the architecture of the structure as an unknown origin. He can't pin it to any culture that he knows of.

Camilla finds that some of the stone tiles on the ground have differing elevation profiles.

We enter the next room and we find a body, we attack the body and in that moment the body disappears and we forget about the entire encounter.

We move forward and find a corridor full of blood as if something large was dragged through it.

As we move along the dripping noise grows louder.

Neil hears a humming noise, and as he blinks his eyes are noticibly dry.

Bit holds mage hand over the guys mouth. And for a second I see the rest of thr group standing around and through a porthole I see a tendril sprint back to hiding.

In the other corner of the room stands Oscar covered in blood.

As we make our way into the next corridor the walls seem to be, moving slightly.

Bit's snake leads the way into the corridor. On the left side of the wall, there is organic debris ripped out of a porthole.

As Samaroth's mage hand hits the organic matter, we hear a gutter wrenching sound except for Neil who hears someone calling out his name and someone screaming out his name, the someone sounds like his mother.

Samaroth gets grabbed by the head and pulled, as this happens Oscar springs into action and begins to save him. However every party memeber has no sight of Samaroth and we see Oscar doing some weird dance. We then help Oscar because we like him.

We end up teleporting through the alarmed door, Samaroth, Oscar, and Camilla kill some rats and Samaroth snags a bag of coin.

Samaroth loots a ring, Camilla loots a well kept cloak off a mage. Doesn't put it on though.

Bit can speak celestial and hears, 'interloapers', the party then attempts to run away as they reach the space where Locke and Oscar know the body disappeared the creature blocks off the exit and Locke screams 'STOPPPP'.

# Episode 20: Holy Shit

Locke takes a couple shots at the tenticle coming out of the porthole.

Initiative is rolled

Neil -> Oscar -> Camilla -> Samaroth -> Locke -> Bit

Oscar hurls a fireball killing it and combat ends.

Oscar gets grabbed, the door shuts behind us.

We lift the door open and Oscar begins to make his way over and escpaes with us.

The ceiling caves in on the hallway as we leave through the staircase in which we came.

Bit is going to learn the spell Oscar used to see the creature.
Bit is going to take a point of exaustion in order to do so.

The space between awake and asleep, the inbetween

Ability to pass between realms is through the inbetween.
If you can feel this place you can pull on the fey realm for power.

Oscar puts me to sleep

For a moment I cannot feel my body. Similar to when I was visited by the fateweaver. I hear 'youre already there' in an echoed state. 'All you need to do is reach out and take it'. Another voice joins and says 'take it.' in a voice that is not the fateweavers.

I return to wake, and oscar is in his changeling state. He returns to human state very tired.

I go to study the spell, and have never seen a spell like this. It is rather foreign. Its odd to see the way that it is translated into arcane form.

Bit wakes up and votes to go to the crash site over the dungeon with the scary monster.
The group then begins to make their way to the crash site.

When we get to the base of the crash site it still smells charred.

We can see there are scatted papers around and an apperatus that is very destroyed. Reminds Locke of a machine from Gizmo's shop.

Locke takes it with him but there is not much he knows about it.

We don't find anything at the crash sites because we aren't great at finding things.

We go back to the dungeon and safely sneak up to the boss monster's lair.

We throw two sneak attacks and fail both of them. We are probably going to get fucked.

Initiative with the monster

False Hydra -> Camilla -> Oscar -> Bit -> Neil -> Locke -> Samaroth

After failing our sneak attacks we proceed to OTK the monster and look to walk into the other room. In the other room there is a corner with treasure and along the walls are pods with moving creatures inside.

# Episode 21: Passage

Locke, Neil, and Samaroth run into the treasure room and trigger a trap like idiots. However, it is no longer functional, so they are ok for now.

Samaroth gets 4163 gold pieces, 9 silver, 2 copper

Neil gets a nice necklace with a very fine purple gemstone.

Locke finds a massive cube, with magical scriptures etched in a language that he is not familiar with. Large but surprisingly light.

We see a somewhat familiar sight in the corner of the room. It looks like the orphus of the creature we had just killed. There is no creature attached to this one though..

I touch the orphus and there is a low rumble everywhere. The current assumption is that the opening belongs to the island creature.

We find Neil's uncle in the sacks on the wall. Neil stabs the sack open and his uncle falls out.

Neil begins to open up the other sacks. The guy he saves throws up and sounds like he is dying. His body looks chemically burned.

The island then continues to shake in response. Some rocks begin to fall from the ceiling and hits Neil and Camilla.

I notice a dwarf on the wall and stealth away from the party to free the dwarf.

We resurrect a frog man hybrid that is rather muscular.

As we reach the surface the island looks a little rough like trees have fallen.

The dwarfs name is Joe Montana.

Torin Oakenshield is the other individual that Neil rescued that was not his uncle.

He's not sure why he was awake in the sack.

Torin's brother is Yelden Oakenshield that can get us off the island. But apparently we aren't to make fun of him because he is going through a life change.

It would be the best if everyone was jolly the whole time.

His brother is a ship. Turned into one by a hag, because he wanted a weapon of great power.

To signal him he sets off a smoke signal that goes 45 feet in the air in a purple hue. Neil collects some purple mist dust.

Seravok was on the island from what it sounds like.

Locke begins to talk to Oscar about the box cube he found in the dungeon.

The dwarf is from the farlands. He was a stowaway on the airships. He was on a ship where the 'deathless' were talking of a very important package which we are currently assuming is the thing Locke has.

Roderick speaks up after some time and points out a ship with large sails approaching. As it moves closer we notice its the ship that launched a tsunami at us.

The first group sails to the ship which includes Camilla, Samaroth, Torin, Neil's father, and the captain of the Pliothea.

Neil questions sebastion about not being a cat.

Neil's father explains that Key is an eonwing. Apparently Neil's mother had one.

We notice a bird with blue eyes flying ahead.

# Episode 22: Against the Clock

As we get to the shore, we discuss our next steps.

While we discuss we notice a caravan of Red Balance members: Mafia crime group.

Neil has a conversation with his father. His father seems to want to head home to the thunder coast.
He wanted Neil to go with him to try and save his mother.
An elderly man lands on top of Neil's father as they are talking.

Neil's father helps the man upstairs to his room and returns to Neil.
On his return he questions Neil's friends - to which Neil suggests they do over some fishing.
While they are fishing, he questions Neil about his friends noting Bit as quiet, Samaroth as ... odd.
He then talks of Camilla stating there is something off with her and Sebastion.

His father then claims he may be able to pull some strings at the Arcanum to be able to look into Camilla's issues.
His father cuts Neil off and says that Treadfang is going to kill him. He asks about when they are to meet next.

As Neil goes upstairs he sees his father unconscious on the stairs with all the doors closed.
The man he was speaking with was a changeling.
Neil heals his father who is barely alive.
His father's choking woke up the innkeeper and he calls guards in.

Morning comes and Neil is exhausted. Camilla is needing food at this point.

We make it to Kruger Kreel's place to go spend some money.

Kruger Kreel's kid got taken by the false hydra invading the city. He has no knowledge of his existance.

I traded Bobby Bazzar's hat for the `Cloak of Protection` and purchased the `Hat of Disguise` and the `Goggles of Night`.
I now have 4 gold to my name but some cool gadgets.
There are some artificers in Dravenhold.

I make it to Everen Vander's place.

I tell him all that happened at the island. He tried offering money but I gave it back.
I would rather have a powerful ally that trusts and respects me. He learned of my relation to the Demon of Duskar.
I told him of the false hydra (which we don't know the name of). Told him of the invasion of the city by changelings and nerves.
I didn't tell him of Oscar or the Fey guy or the infinite well.
I also checked him to be a changeling. Silently casting charm person and he passed for the time being.
He said I should check in with him before I leave.

We meet at Gizmo's place.

We open a chest cavity of something. There are small balls of refined oracalcum in the chest of the automaton.

Locke takes a piece of refined oracalcum. There were 7 in the automaton, Gizmo said that it should only need one to power it for 100 years.

Neil steals a piece of oracalcum and goes unnoticed.

Oscar has noticed people missing. He spoke with Ozen mind shielded and there have been news of Crimean troops encroaching on the border.
If Crimea is involved at all, aiding the farlanders, this is just what Seravok and the Fateweaver wanted.
The king is returning to Daein from Imperia, he belives it safer here. He grows paranoid.

Question Oscar about who Oscar was before he changed into him.

This monster has been in the city far longer than we thought.
Also there may be people already infested with nervous systems.
Gizmo may be one of those people.

As the questions for Oscar die down we approach the Lawmaster's office.

Locke speaks with Neil's father nothing of importance.

Its proven that Neil is the one in Oscar's prophecy. Based on a song Neil's father sung.

Camilla gave the ship a gift. And Torin takes in the frog man so he will not be joining us on our adventure.

# Episode 23: The first of many

We prepare to enter the law-master's office.

We quickly enter the office and march past everyone straight to Ozen's office.
We barge through the doors without announcement.
Ozen is standing in the middle of the room, as we emerged we heard a conversation.
However, we enter to no one but Ozen in the room. She appears to have a noticeable earpiece.

Ozen gets ready to venture into the lair of the creature.

Camilla questions the immediate call to action of Ozen.
Is there anything that we may be leaving behind unguarded for the enemy.

We enter the sewers and begin our way to where we think the monster may be: the overflow reservoir.

We come across a lantern and as we do Locke falls over a crack and makes a large banging sound as he screams.

As we make it into the chamber we see the False Hydra in the middle of the chamber.

"Well don't be shy, come on in" we hear from the chamber.

Ozen walks in and turns to talk to the person we cannot see.

He says "What's wrong are the rest of your friends shy?"

Our party makes their way in and we see on a raised platform, with a finely pointed rapier in his hand.

"Yes I would like to lay eyes on the group that has been causing us so much trouble." said Seravok.

"So tell me, is that all of them?" says Seravok. And out comes the armored battle mage we fought before that got away.

As he speaks of the false hydra a tenticle moves from behind Seravok.

These creatures only come from where nature rules, the astral sea has many gifts. He mentions something about taming the untamable.

False hydras seem to be from the Astral sea.

We notice a very thin invisible shield around the false hydra being supplied by three pillars around the room.

Battle Order

# Episode 24: Bitter sweet

Locke and Samaroth go down

Seravok is killed and absorbed into Bit's ring.

Neil dies. The rest of the party leaves the dungeon and that is where the episode ends.

> Really unfortunate to see Neil die there. I'm not sure I could have done anything personally. But Bit is a rather selfish character unless they help him reach his goals. What are Bit's goals?
> Maverick is sorta getting on some nerves with his inability to show up and his lack of being aware during the game.

Next episode starts with us exiting the sewers after the long fought battle.

# Episode 25: Aftermath

Neil gets revived due to some Samaroth (Maverick) issues and not showing up.
I think this means that Samaroth is dead?

Jasper Kreel and a dwarven man were rescued from the sewers.

As we exit the sewers we see ruin. The Stonemarsh Arcanum is sundered, and the city is in a state of panic.
Injured all around, Dravenguard trying to help as they can. Ozen frozen for a moment, begins to calmly walk to the law master's office.

Ozen yells for Oscar with no response. We all follow Ozen and as we approach the office the roof is caving in on itself.

She opens the door as Dravenguard try and pull us each way as they notice that we have a multitude of bodies in our company.
Ozen commands them to move. We approach her office and Ozen says "where is Oscar."
Oscar was one of the targets of the assault and was gravely wounded.
He's being treated in the office.
The Demon of Duskar stands in the doorway covered in blood and soot.

We perform a ritual to revive Neil.

Locke's Letter:
Trust sparingly the devil does not come dressed in a red cape and pointy horns, he comes as everything you could have ever wanted.
Signed Locke's Father.

Lt. Fisk Gravepool

the knock to kruger kreels place is dum dudum dum

Noelle Clad - Vander's opposition

Vander is going to the farlands, hitching a ride with a vessel.

# Episode 26: The long road ahead

Camilla feasts on Neil at 11am, results in Neil's exaustion.

A guard approaches us, named Mark Andrews, and asks what he can do for us.

Locke explains that we are needed to see the lawmaster.

Ozen is talking with the guy that I held with my snake staff while Camilla was escaping prosecution.

Locke asks about the note that was returned destroyed.
The Lt. Fisk in mention was a battle strategist.

Ozen gave Bit a communication device for two-way communication.
We can send one message and receive one message a day.
25 words.

Ozen throws down the `Seal of the Lawmaster` on the table. She explains that it may get us out of some trouble if needed. However it doesn't hold a lot of weight unless it is shown to one of more importance.
High ranking government officials, high ranking military types.

Samaroth apparently rose from the dead and walked out of his grave, without shoes.

Sven is there with our horse and gives Camilla a hard time.

> Horses 'Chugga Chugga' when they travel.

On the way we find some random from a town called Hallow's Brooke just North East of our current position on the path to Dravenhold.

# Episode 27: Halloween Episode

Looking for matilda whos looking for this lady violet.

Neil is driving the cart. We rolled a 4 for the day. Violet speaks up and says it should only be another 3 or 4 hours from here. Not too long.

A thick fog rolls in with a 30 foot visual distance.
Violet seems strangely unfazed by the mist.
She says 'we should be there any minute now'
Neil senses joy in what she says but somehow he doesn't get the feeling it comes with malice.

Violet starts to transform and we kick her and then guiding bolt her. She died of splattered organs.

We are now almost there and are wondering wtf to do.

We make it to the tavern in hallows brooke.

Every 28th of Tyros there is a Saucing Hour when the moon rises highest in the sky at midnight. We are visited by a beast of the forest, a demon that only makes it's preseance known. Takes a dozen of us every year. We board the windos and hide but the creature continues to terrorize us here in Hallows Brooke.
Creature looks gourd-like.

Walks into the center of town and roars, then it feasts.

I can also give you some time to prepare the area in a way that seems fit.

Bit and Camilla almost got married for 2 AC for 7 days.

We find the monster

Camilla -> Locke -> Pumpkin King -> Neil -> Bit

>[!NOTE]
    If you transform a creature they are cleansed of any conditions.

# Episode 28: What the path holds

We wake up in the back of our carriage a little sore and the sun is barely up.

We begin travel and we end up parallel with another traveler in the pouring rain.

We find an abandon cottage in the forest.

Bit obtains a +1 to all potato soup rolls because he is getting rather skilled in cooking.

Camilla finds a body in the woods while she went out hunting

Bit Locke and Neil get ambushed by the Red Balance.

Apparently Locke is wanted for murder, slaughter of children.
It's because he's part of the bitter brew accord.

Clyde corners us and questions Locke a bit, wants to take him in alive.
We attack Clyde when we hear a scream from the tree line.

Neil -> Locke -> Clyde -> Red Balance -> Bit -> Creature -> Camilla

# Episode 29: The Fate's Monitstary

Last EP it was raining and we stumbled across some guy that was in the red balance. We got ganked and there was a wild creature that killed pretty much all of them, looks like Ornn from league.
Conversations began between Locke and the Red Balance guy. He tried to get Locke peacefully to get a tiefling off their backs.
Something about the Eye of Toot. We are victorious and we stand in the near vicinity of the creature.

I begin to talk to the creature telepathically, and it seems very confused.
I talk out loud to it and apologize and it seems to not like the telepathic talking option.
Neil runs over to it and attempts to cure its wounds.
The creature takes a seat and thanks Neil for the assistance.

He destroys Sebastion as he approaches the creature and he touches his chest and says "Emissary"
He blames the Red Balance for what has happened to him.

Neil asks him to join the camp, Sebastion called him an idiot.

I go to bed as Locke so that if any red balance members appear they won't know who to take.
Neil sleeps by the creature, and Camilla does a ritual at night.

Emissary doesn't understand what a mother is.
As Neil mentions home, the creature stands up. He says "Emissary goes home"

Neil got touched by the thing and went through a fever dream.
Emissary writes his name in the mud in old valierian.
Locke understands it.
Emissary has the symbol of Destin on a ring on his arm.

Emissary find purpose.
Emissary go home.

Neil checks out the lead red balance guy for tattoos.

We go back to bed.

Neil might have gotten a cool ring, but it took some HP.
Emissary turns and leaves towards his home, without saying a word.

During our 3 days of travel we find a medium sized muel, we find a chunky Dwarven man.
He has some exotic animals, Camilla is browsing his wares.

We make it to the Sept of Destin, we meet brother Aric.

Destin is a fair and firm diety. He is followed by those around the world with any walks of life.
The threads of fate are ever changing for all.

High priestess Lirael

Hall of weaves, the hearth of the church.

We find an elderly woman, (unlucky), that we assume to be the high priestess.

She ushers Locke to the Shrine of Choice.

The librarian, bob the builder. Has never seen a 'tabaxi' in the form of sebastion

5 myths:
the threads of the unseen
